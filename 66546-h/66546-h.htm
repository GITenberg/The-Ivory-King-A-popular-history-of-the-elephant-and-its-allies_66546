</div>

<p>The elephant is the true king of beasts, the largest and most
powerful of existing land animals, and to young and old a
never ceasing source of wonder and interest. In former geological
ages, it roamed the continental areas of every zone; was found in
nearly every section of North America, from the shores of the
Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, and from New England to
California. Where the hum of great cities is now heard, in bygone
days the trumpeting of the mastodon and elephant, and
the cries of other strange animals, broke the stillness of the
vast primeval forest. But they have all passed away, their
extirpation undoubtedly hastened by the early man, the aboriginal
hunter; and the mighty race of elephants, which now
remains so isolated, is to-day represented by only two species,
the African and the Asiatic, forms which are also doomed.</p>

<p>To produce the eight hundred tons of ivory used annually,
nearly seventy-five thousand elephants are destroyed; and it does
not require the gift of prophecy to foresee their extinction in the
near future. The Asiatic elephant is said to be holding its own;
but the rapid advance of the British in the East, the introduction
of railroads and improvements which mark the progress of civilization
in India, where heretofore the elephant has been employed,
cannot fail to have a fatal effect, and their extermination is only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
a matter of time. Knowing these facts, and the close relationship
which the elephant has ever held in the advancement of mankind
in the East, it stands a picture of absorbing interest, the
last of a powerful race, worthy of earnest efforts for its preservation.
The question of its extinction rests with the rising
generation. In America and England the ornithologists have
made an appeal for our feathered friends, and ladies have been
asked to put their veto upon the excessive use of feathers, which
is surely tending to the extermination of our birds. The elephant
can be protected in the same way. Every ivory tusk that is
brought to the African coast from the interior is said to cost a
human life; and that we may have ivory fans, billiard-balls,
chessmen, knife-handles, inlaid furniture, grotesque Japanese statuary,
etc., the elephant, who has been man’s helpmate from 1200
B.C., and perhaps earlier, to the present day, is threatened with
extermination. The prominence of the elephant in early times
is, I think, not generally appreciated. There was hardly a great
public movement entailing war, in the early days of the East, in
which these animals did not constitute an all-important element.
Defeat and success were, as a rule, determined by the number of
elephants; and the fate of nations may be said to have depended
upon the prowess of the proboscidians.</p>

<p>In the present volume, I have endeavored to present as much
of the history of the elephant as is compatible with popular interest,
treating the animal in all its relations to man, and the economic
questions involved: in war, pageantry, sports and games,
as a faithful laborer and servant, comrade and friend, its ancestral
forms, structure and anatomy. As the work is in no sense a
scientific one, the student may regret the absence of details relating
to anatomy, etc. To compensate for such omission, I have
appended a carefully selected bibliography of all the most important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
works, papers, and monographs, ancient and recent, relating
to the subject.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Mr. George P. Sanderson, officer in charge
of the elephant-catching establishment at Mysore, Bengal, whose
valuable work embracing his experience with the Asiatic elephant
has been frequently consulted; also to the works of Sir Emerson
Tennent, and especially to the author of “Menageries,” published
by Messrs. Charles Knight &amp; Co., London.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">NATURAL HISTORY OF THE ELEPHANT.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The elephant is the largest living land animal; and,
though numerous forms existed in early geological
times, it is represented to-day by two species only,—the
African elephant, <i>Elephas Africanus</i>, and the Asiatic elephant,
<i>Elephas Indicus</i>. The geographical range of the former originally
included nearly all Africa, but now the animals are
more closely confined to the central interior regions. The
Asiatic elephant is found in the forests of India, Ceylon,
Burmah, Siam, Cochin China, Sumatra, and the Malay peninsula;
and, while the introduction of railroads into these
countries in ensuing years will perhaps result in its extinction,
at present its numbers are not growing less. The
African elephant differs from its Asiatic cousin in several
particulars. The apparent distinguishing features are the
tusks that attain a much greater development and occur in
both sexes, while in the Asiatic species the males alone possess
them. The African elephant is at least a foot higher
than the Asiatic, attaining a maximum height of eleven feet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Its ears are extremely large, covering the shoulder, and in
some instances measuring three and a half feet in length
by two and a half feet in width, while those of its Indian
relative are comparatively small.</p>

<p>When Jumbo—who was an African elephant—and one
of the Asiatic elephants stood side by side, the difference was
very marked. The summit of the head of the Indian species
forms a pyramid, while the front, or forehead, is concave. In
Jumbo the front of the head was somewhat convex, the eye was
larger; and when we compare the feet, we find that while
the African elephant has, as a rule, four nails on each foot, the
Asiatic has four on each hind-foot, and five on each fore-foot.
The number of nails often varies with individuals. The
Indian natives esteem those animals most which possess five
on each fore-foot, and four on each hind-foot, or eighteen,
odd numbers being considered unlucky. The author of
“Oriental Field Sports” says that he has observed elephants
with fifteen nails, which no native would purchase; and he
heard of one with twenty, and saw one with eighteen. These
differences are external, as all elephants possess five toes
upon each foot internally. The two species also differ as to
their teeth. The incisor teeth of elephants are greatly developed,
forming the tusks, and only occur in the upper jaw
of living forms. They often attain enormous size, weighing
from one hundred and fifty to three hundred pounds. The
tusks of the Asiatic elephants born in this country were visible
at birth. Concerning them in general, Sanderson states
that they are not renewed, but are permanent; his information
being based upon the personal observations of many
years. Corse, who made observations in the last century, and
published them in the “Philosophical Transactions,” 1799,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
states that the elephants observed by him had milk, or deciduous
tusks as well as permanent ones; that the milk-tusks
appeared at about six months of age and fell out between
the first and second years. He found in the young skull the
place of the capsule of the permanent tusks, which appear a
couple of months after the loss of the milk-tusks. Huxley
says, “In recent elephants, only the two incisors are preceded
by milk-teeth;” and this may be the generally accepted
belief. The tusks have no roots like the teeth of some animals,
but fit firmly into what are called premaxillary sockets:
and if we should examine this buried or hidden portion, we
should find that it was partly hollow, so to speak; the ivory
at the root being very thin, and surrounding a pulp where
the ivory is being secreted. The length of this soft pulp
varies according to the age of the animal: thus, in young elephants,
only a small portion of the tusk outside of the gum
is solid ivory; all the rest being hollow, or containing the
pulp. As the animal grows, this cavity decreases in length,
until in extremely old elephants it disappears entirely and
the tusk is solid ivory.</p>

<p>In the left tusk of the elephant shot by Sir Victor Brooke
(<a href="#Page_115">p. 115</a>), the pulp-cavity was wholly obliterated, its place
occupied by an exceedingly dense nodular dentine. This
tusk was diseased. In the right tusk of the same animal the
pulp-hollow extended from the base through half the imbedded
portion, or thirteen and a half inches. In a pair of tusks
owned by Col. Douglas Hamilton, of the British army, the
pulp-cavity occupies ten inches and a half of the imbedded
length. From this it is evident that the length of a tusk
cannot be accurately determined from mere observation, as
in a large elephant the sockets are from one foot six inches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
to one foot nine inches in length; so that an animal might
have a tusk three feet and a half long, and show only one
foot and a half of it, the gum alone concealing about four
inches.</p>

<p>As the ivory is so soft at the base of the tusk, it is evident
that it can be easily broken; and, if a bullet or spear strikes
this spot, it becomes embedded, and eventually incorporated,
in the tusk. Workers in ivory are often surprised to find a
leaden bullet in the solid ivory. In a collection in London,
there is a section of a tusk which was cut at a piano-forte
manufactory in 1805, which has a wrought-iron musket-ball
firmly embedded in it; and other instances can be seen in
the museum of the London University.</p>

<p>In their growth, tusks often assume strange shapes, being
liable to twist, just as the horns of a cow. Livingstone saw
an elephant with three tusks, the third one growing out between
the other two. The tusks frequently grow straight;
some twist in a spiral, others form a complete circle; and
many elephants have only one from birth,—like the fictitious
unicorn. These animals are called <i>Gunésh</i> by the natives.
The name is that of the Hindoo god of wisdom; and, if the
single tusk of the <i>Gunésh</i> is the right one, the animal is
reverenced. Some dimensions of tusks will be given in
the chapter on Ivory. Perhaps the largest was one sold in
Amsterdam some years ago. It weighed, according to Kolokner,
three hundred and fifty pounds. Eden measured several
nine feet in length, and one described by Hartenfels exceeded
fourteen feet. There is one in the museum of Natural History,
Paris, seven feet in length. The uses to which the large
incisors are put, are often exaggerated. The African elephant
employs its tusks to uproot small mimosa-trees, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
they are never used to overthrow as large objects as is often
stated. Sir Samuel Baker measured mimosa-trees four feet
six inches in circumference, and thirty feet high, which elephants
had pulled down; and the damage they cause in a
mimosa-forest is almost incredible. These trees, however,
have no tap-root, and are comparatively easy to overthrow.
Gumming says, “I have repeatedly ridden through forests
where the trees thus broken down lay so thick across one
another that it was almost impossible to ride through the
district.” The female elephant uses her tusks to scrape
the barks from trees; but the large tusks of the males are
designed as a defence,—the elephant with the finest tusks
ruling the herd,—and terrific wounds are made by them.
The elephant Conqueror, in this country, was killed by being
gored in this way; and in India, when it is necessary at the
government corral to subdue a mad elephant, a reliable tusker
is provided with steel tusks, or glavies, which fit over the
stumps of the others, and with these they do terrible work.</p>

<p>If we examine the skull of the elephant, we find only two
molar teeth on each side of each jaw,—eight in all; and no
more, as a rule, are seen at one time, twenty-four in all
appearing during the lifetime of an elephant.</p>

<p>The teeth appear in a curious way, moving gradually forward
from behind in regular succession; each old front tooth
as it is worn away being pushed out of place by its successor.
This wonderful provision is necessary, as the front teeth are
worn away by the sand and gritty substances taken in with
the food. The molar, or grinding, teeth are extremely heavy
and large, and are nearly buried in the socket, the upper portion
only showing. They are made up of a number of transverse
perpendicular plates composed of a mass of dentine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
incased in an outside layer of enamel, which is in turn covered
by a layer of cement that fills the spaces between the
plates, and seems to bind the whole together. Each of the
enamel plates, though appearing separate at the surface, is
connected with the others at the base. The difference between
the teeth of the Indian and African species is shown
in <a href="#plate1">Plate I.</a> In the Indian elephant the ridges of enamel are
narrower, more undulating, and appear in greater numbers
than in the African species, in which the ridges are less parallel,
and enclose lozenge-shaped spaces. There are certain
other differences in the species, such as the number of bones
in the vertebral column, or “backbone;” those of the African
elephant numbering from twenty to twenty-one, and those of
the Indian elephant nineteen to twenty. In examining the
skull of an elephant, we are struck with its enormous size,
and the comparatively small space taken up by the brain.
The skull is not so heavy as it appears, the interior being
divided off into partitions, or air-cells; so that, while there is
a large surface for the attachment of the trunk-muscles, the
head is massive, but not heavy. The neck of the elephant is
so short, that, without some special provision, it could not feed
from the ground; and this is seen in the trunk, or proboscis,
that is a prolongation of the upper lip and nose, sometimes
seven feet in length. It commences at the nasal opening of
the face, contains a pair of tubes closed by a valvular arrangement,
and at its end on the upper side is a small prolongation
like a finger, opposite which is a prominence, or tubercle, that
acts as a thumb. The trunk is made up of a vast number of
muscles, estimated by Cuvier at about forty thousand. Upon
the outside, the trunk appears to be ringed; and it is a most
remarkable organ, combining the offices of a hand and nose,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
and exercising taste, touch, suction, expulsion, and prehension.
With it the elephant lifts its driver, pulls over small trees,
reaches for its food, takes in water which is in turn expelled
into the mouth, squirts water or sand over its body; in fact,
there is hardly any thing, from drawing a cork from a bottle,
to hurling a tiger into the air, that this wonderful trunk cannot
do for its owner. Without it the elephant would starve.
One in India which had lost its trunk, had to be fed by having
food placed in its mouth. Though the trunk is so useful, it
is a very tender and delicate organ, and is not used in the
rough manner generally supposed. In making an attack, it
is raised high in air out of the way. When a great weight is
lifted, it is not the trunk, but the tusks, which are employed,
the former only holding the object upon the latter.</p>

<p>Once, when visiting the herd of elephants owned by Mr.
Barnum, the trainer called my attention to a small hole, or
opening of a gland, situated on each side of the head between
the eye and the ear, that is scarcely perceptible. It is the
opening of a duct, perhaps two inches in length, that extends
toward the lachrymal organs, and leads to a secretory gland.
From this orifice, there exudes at times a thick, gummy substance,
which sometimes clogs up the opening, and undoubtedly
affects the animal unpleasantly; as, when this is
filled, the trainer told me that the elephant would take a
small stick or straw in its trunk, and endeavor to remove the
obstruction. This will be alluded to in the chapter on Rogue
Elephants. This exudation is generally considered a warning
in the East, that the elephant is going to be ugly, and is
called <i>must</i>. In Asiatic wild elephants it occurs usually in
cold weather, from November to February. This peculiarity
has been noticed from the earliest times: it was remarked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
upon by Strabo, and is referred to in Hindoo mythology.
“The Hindoo poets frequently allude to the fragrant juice
which oozes, at certain seasons, from small ducts in the temples
of the male elephant, and is useful in relieving him from
the redundant moisture with which he is then oppressed;
and they even describe the bees as allured by the scent, and
mistaking it for that of the sweetest flowers. When Crishna
visited Sanc’ha-dwip, and had destroyed the demon who
infested that delightful country, he passed along the bank
of a river, and was charmed with a delicious odor which its
waters diffused in their course. He was eager to view the
source of so fragrant a stream, but was informed by the
natives that it flowed from the temples of an elephant,
immensely large, milk-white, and beautifully formed; that
he governed a numerous race of elephants, and the odoriferous
fluid which exuded from his temples had formed the
river.”</p>

<p>It is evident that wild elephants probe this opening, which is
a little larger than a pin-head, and that the sticks used often
break off in the orifice, and by working in give the animals
such agony that they go mad for the time. When Mr. Cowper
Rose shot an elephant in Africa, the men immediately
began to hunt for the “piece of wood in the head, to which
they attached great value as a charm.” Mr. Rose was evidently
not familiar with the gland, or opening. He says, “I
sat on one (a dead elephant) while they searched for the
wood in his head. It lies about an inch beneath the skin,
embedded in fat, just above the eye, and has the appearance
of a thorn, or a small piece of twig broken off. Some are
without it: and, on examining the spot minutely, we found
that there was a small opening in the skin,—a large pore, it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
may be; and I conceive that this phenomenon is simply
accounted for by the twig breaking in this hole when the
animal is in the act of rubbing his head against the bushes.”</p>

<p>The body of the elephant, weighing sometimes three tons,
is supported by four ponderous, pillar-like legs, the movements
of which, especially the posterior, or hinder pair attract
immediate attention; and the first impression is, that the hind-legs
of the elephant are entirely different from those of any
other mammal. They seem to bend in the wrong direction.
The difference consists merely in the greater length of the
thigh-bone, or femur, which brings the knee much farther down
than in other animals. The horse is equally remarkable for
an opposite reason; as it walks and stands upon the toe-nail
of its single toe, while its heel is as high up as the knee of
the elephant is low. Covering this wonderful frame, or skeleton,
is the loose, wrinkled skin an inch thick, so tough and
heavy,—often weighing eight hundred pounds,—that the elephant
and others were at one time included in a group called
the thick-skinned animals (pachyderms). The skin is comparatively
hairless; though some elephants have more than
others, and young ones more than adults. The theory generally
accepted, is that the elephants of southern countries
have lost their hair by long-continued residence in regions
where it was not necessary. Quite recently two young or
dwarfed Asiatic elephants were exhibited in New York as
mammoths, on account of their superabundance of hair; but
it is needless to say that they were ordinary Asiatic elephants.</p>

<p class="tb">In the present work, it is not necessary to refer particularly
to the internal organization of the elephant, but the subject
is replete with interest. The enormous heart, a foot in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
diameter, in its contraction exerts tons of pressure; and the
blood forced out by it must attain almost the force of water
from the hose of a fire-engine. Hunters have often been
astonished at seeing elephants, which they have been chasing
for some time, insert their trunks into their mouths, and
there obtain a supply of water that is blown over the dry
and heated body. The explanation of this is, that the stomach
of the elephant resembles that of the camel, in having a
chamber that can be cut off or separated from the digestive
cavity, in which about ten gallons of water is stored as a
reserve supply, or to be used as occasion requires.</p>

<p>The female elephant is generally smaller than the male.
The mammary glands are situated between the fore-legs, and
the calf nurses with its mouth, instead of the trunk as was
once supposed. The period of gestation is about five hundred
and ninety-seven days. The weight of the elephant at
birth differs in individuals. One observed by Owen weighed
one hundred and seventy-five pounds, and stood two feet ten
inches in height. The little elephant Bridgeport weighed
two hundred and forty-five pounds at birth, and stood three
feet in height. The baby elephant America, born in Philadelphia,
weighed two hundred and thirteen and a half
pounds, and measured thirty-four inches and a half at the
shoulder. It grew so rapidly, that in eleven months it gained
about seven hundred pounds,—not so very surprising, as it
came of a very heavy family. Its mother weighed seven
thousand and twenty pounds, and was only twenty-three
years old; and the father, who was three years older, four
tons. The baby’s trunk, or proboscis, was at first twelve
inches long, and nine inches in circumference at the root, or
base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>The young Asiatic elephant grows about eleven inches in
the first year, eight in the second, six inches in the third,
five in the fourth, five in the fifth, in the sixth three and a
half, and in the seventh, two and a half, the measurements
having been made by Mr. Corse.</p>

<span class="smaller">HABITS AND WAYS OF ELEPHANTS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The most favorable locality to observe wild elephants in
India is in Mysore, where the western ghats, the Billiga-rungun
hills, and the Goondulpet and Kákankoté forests,
afford fine opportunities to the naturalist and sportsman to
observe the largest of living land animals in the haunts of
its choice. It is here that the elephant-catcher of the British
Government, Mr. George P. Sanderson, makes his headquarters,
and has obtained such signal success for many
years.</p>

<p>Wild Asiatic elephants usually travel in herds of from
thirty to fifty, though sometimes the number is swelled to
one hundred and over; but small herds are the rule, this
division allowing them to obtain a much larger supply of
food. The necessity of this can be better appreciated when
it is known that a band of one hundred elephants require, or
will consume, eighty thousand pounds of fodder in a day.</p>

<p>The favorite food of the wild Asiatic elephant in Ceylon
is palms, especially the cabbage, the young trunks of palmyra
and jaggery (<i>Caryota urens</i>). They are also very fond of
figs, the sacred Bo-tree (<i>F. religiosa</i>) found near the temples,
as well as the Negaha (<i>Messua ferrea</i>). The leaves of the
jak-tree are considered a great luxury by the huge creatures;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
while the bread-fruit, wood-apple, sugar-cane, palm, pineapple,
watermelon, and the feathery part of the bamboo, are all to
its taste. Among the grasses, the mauritius and Guinea grass
are eaten; and all the grains. Cocoanuts they break by
rolling them under foot.</p>

<p>The African elephant affects the succulent mimosa, and
larger shoots and branches than its cousin, its teeth being
fitted for a coarser diet. They are, according to Drummond,
particularly fond of the fruit of the unganu-tree, which
seems to intoxicate them; as they stagger about, performing
the most remarkable antics for a clumsy beast; often trumpeting
so loudly that they can be heard for miles, and
sometimes engaging in terrific encounters.</p>

<p>When separated into small herds, the elephants all move
in concert, as if there was a mutual understanding as to the
general route to be taken. Elephants are extremely sure-footed,
and will climb quite steep hills. A paper in the Journal
of the Asiatic Society of Bengal describes the methods
adopted by the elephant in going down-hill. The writer
says, “An elephant descending a bank of too acute an angle
to admit of his walking down it direct (which were he to
attempt, his huge body, soon disarranging the centre of gravity,
would certainly topple over), proceeds thus: his first
manœuvre is to kneel down close to the edge of the declivity,
placing his chest to the ground. One fore-leg is then cautiously
passed a short way down the slope; and, if there is no
natural protection to afford a firm footing, he speedily forms
one by stamping into the soil if moist, or picking out a footing
if dry. This point gained, the other fore-leg is brought
down in the same way, and performs the same work, a little
in advance of the first, which is thus at liberty to move lower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
still. Then the first one of the hind-legs is carefully drawn
over the side, and then the second; and the hind-feet in
turn occupy the resting-places previously used and left by
the first ones. The course, however, in such precipitous
ground is not straight from top to bottom, but slopes along
the face of the bank, descending till the animal gains the
level below. This an elephant has done at an angle of forty-five
degrees, carrying a howdah, its occupant, his attendant,
and sporting apparatus, and in much less time than it takes
to describe the operation. I have observed that an elephant
in descending a declivity uses his knees on the side next the
bank, and his feet on the lower side only.” Elephants are
often described as galloping, leaping, and gambolling about
like a horse. Such movements are impossible; the only gait
being a walk, that can be increased to a very rapid shuffle
of fifteen miles an hour for a short distance. It appears to
move the legs on the same side together, but this is not exactly
so. Elephants cannot leap, and never have all four feet
from the ground at the same time. Sanderson says, “I have
seen an elephant go over quite high hurdles, but never take
all four feet from the ground at once. Even the smallest
spring is beyond its power; a small trench seven feet across
being quite impossible by the largest elephant, although its
stride may be six feet and a half long.”</p>

<p>The sense of smell is so delicate that a tame elephant will
recognize the presence of a wild one three miles away, and
by its actions inform the mahout. Selous, the African hunter,
watched a herd of elephants cross his trail from a place of
security below them; and the moment the trunk of the leader
crossed the spot where his foot had been, it stopped, waved
its proboscis a few moments, then turned and ran, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
by the entire band. The herds of elephants, when
divided, are family parties, generally all related, and on the
march. The mothers with young always take the lead; the
old tuskers following along in the rear, taking the front, however,
in case of alarm. This method of procedure might
appear strange at first; but the mothers probably know how
long a tramp the calves can endure, and so the responsibility
is left to them.</p>

<p>All of my young readers who have visited the circus,
must have heard the trumpeting of elephants. This is
one of their methods of communication: in other words,
elephants have a language that is expressed in different
ways,—sometimes by the throat, and, again, by the trunk.
When an elephant is pleased, it expresses it by a squeaking
noise,—a most ear-grating sound made in the trunk. It
also purrs gently, often so low that the keeper alone hears it.
When fully enraged, and rushing upon an enemy, its war-cry
is a shrill trumpeting that no one can mistake. Rage is
also expressed by a low, hoarse rumbling in the throat. Fear
or pain is manifested by a shrill squeak, and sometimes by a
loud, reverberating roar. The expression of misapprehension
or suspicion is entirely different from that of fear, being
shown by rapping the trunk upon the ground sharply, at the
same time emitting a volume of air from the trunk, that is
said to sound like a sheet of tin being rapidly doubled. Desire
or want is expressed by the throat, especially in young elephants;
and any one who watched the famous baby elephant
Bridgeport, must have heard the curious sounds it uttered.</p>

<p>In the open country the elephant seems to have regular
trails, or drives, that are followed season after season with
some regularity. During the dry time, that in India is from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
January to April, they follow the beds of streams, and seek
the deep forests, there finding protection from the intense
heat; but when the rain commences, in June, they roam into
the open country, grazing upon the new and fresh grass produced
by the warm showers. With the latter also come innumerable
flies, that also drive them out into the low jungles;
one, a huge insect as large as a bee, with a long proboscis,
being especially irritating. At this time they frequent the
salt-licks, and have been seen to eat earth impregnated with
soda. This is the elephant’s medicine, certain kinds of earth
being eaten for the same reason that dogs eat grass.</p>

<p>When the dry season comes, and the grass is withered and
bitter, the herds leave the lowlands, remaining in the hills
until the next season. Almost the entire time is spent in
grazing; though they are often seen after a rain warming
their great bodies in the sun, or standing upon the open rocks
that form a characteristic of the hills of the Mysore country.
When the fodder is exhausted in a locality, the march is
taken up, and invariably in Indian file; so that it is often
difficult to tell whether ten or one hundred elephants are
ahead. Upon reaching a good locality, they disperse, and
remain in the vicinity for two days or so. Their rest is taken,
as a rule, in the middle of the night; particular friends lying
down together, or often a family party. They are early risers,
and by three o’clock in the morning are either feeding, or on
the march. At ten o’clock they will perhaps collect for a
rest, then from four in the afternoon until eleven at night
they feed or march. There are, of course, exceptions to this.
In very cool or wet weather they march all day, and often
for various reasons do not lie down for several days at a time.
Elephants sleep like horses, either standing or lying down.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
The latter is the natural way, though the process of assuming
a reclining position is a somewhat difficult one. When
first captured, they often do not lie down for weeks. It is
stated that an elephant owned by Louis XIV. did not lie
down for the last five years of its life. It wore two holes in
the stone buttress with its tusks, and seemed to support itself
to some extent in this way while it slept. Wild African elephants
have been observed leaning against a tree in the forests.
The enormous ears of the African elephant are used
as fans; and when a herd is seen upon a hot day, these huge
members are continually moving, either to create a current
of air, or to blow away the insect pests with which they are
infested. They have also been seen to take a branch in their
trunks to brush away flies, using it as a person would a fan.
The hearing of the elephant is very acute, much more so than
in man; experiment having shown that a female heard her
young when the sound was inaudible to a party of Englishmen
between her and the calf.</p>

<p>Sir Everard Home experimented with an elephant by
musical sounds, and came to the conclusion that it did not
possess a musical ear, though it was attracted by certain
notes. He says, “I got Mr. Broadwood, as a matter of
curiosity, to send one of his tuners with a piano-forte to the
menageries of wild beasts in Exeter Change, that I might
know the effect of acute and grave sounds upon the ear of a
full-grown elephant. The acute sounds seemed hardly to
attract his notice; but as soon as the grave notes were struck,
he became all attention, brought forward the large external
ear, tried to discover where the sounds came from, remained
in the attitude of listening, and after some time made noises
by no means of dissatisfaction.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>The elephant is extremely fond of water; and soon after
sunrise the Asiatic species can be seen sporting in the
streams, floundering about, and spouting water over their
huge bodies, piping and trumpeting with conflicting emotions.
They are very susceptible to cold, and when obliged to enter
water at night, or when it is chilly, are careful to lift their
tails and trunks above the surface if possible.</p>

<p>So clumsy an animal would hardly be expected to excel in
swimming, yet probably few land animals can compete with
them in this respect. In 1875 Mr. Sanderson sent a herd of
seventy-nine from Dacca to Barrackpur near Calcutta, and
during the march they had to cross the Ganges and several
large tributaries. In one place the entire herd swam without
touching bottom for six consecutive hours: then after resting
a while on a sand-bank, they swam three more, or nine in all,
with but one rest. Few land animals could accomplish this
without losing some of their number. But Mr. Sanderson
states that he has heard of swims even more remarkable than
this. Notwithstanding their fine swimming powers, elephants
are sometimes drowned by very simple means; and Mr. Sanderson
records such an instance: “We had left the Myanee
above its junction with the Kurnafoolie, and were marching
by land; but, owing to the lie of the country, we had to
cross the Kurnafoolie occasionally. It was very deep, and
the elephants had to swim. One morning, whilst crossing
where it was about eighty yards wide and thirty feet deep in
a gorge through a saddle in the hills, a tusker which was
secured between two tame ones, one in advance of, and one
behind, him, sank like a stone, probably from being seized
with cramp from the coldness of the water, and dragged the
two females with him. Their mahouts tried in vain to slash<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the ropes through: they had barely time to save themselves
by swimming. Any thing more sudden or unexpected I
never witnessed. One elephant appeared again for a brief
moment, at least about two feet of her trunk did: she waved
us a last farewell, when all was still save the air-bubbles
which continued to rise for some time from the calm, deep
pool. Every one who witnessed it was shocked. The
drivers of the elephants yet to cross hesitated. We could
not believe the unfortunate beasts would not come up again.
The mahouts sat down, and cried like children over the loss
of the faithful beasts they had tended for years. Elephants
are such good swimmers, that I cannot understand how it was
that the two tame ones were unable to gain the shore, which
was only twenty yards distant, by towing the wild one.
When they floated, we found that they were in no way entangled;
and it was not owing to snags catching the ropes, nor to
any undercurrent, that they were drawn down. One of the
tame ones, Geraldine, was a great favorite of mine; and she
and the other were worth twelve hundred dollars each. The
tusker was worth twenty-four hundred, so the money lost to
the government was considerable.”</p>

<p>No subject relating to elephants is so difficult to determine
by a mere casual examination, as that relating to its size.
Statements from natives can never be relied upon; as in times
of excitement a large bull will appear twenty feet high, and
the observers are not at all unwilling to make affidavit to
that effect. Asiatic elephants rarely, if ever, attain a height
of ten feet at the shoulder. The largest in the Madras commissariat
stud to-day measures nine feet ten inches. The next
largest is owned by his Highness the Mahárájah of Mysore,
and measures nine feet two inches, and is forty years old.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Females are usually smaller. Two in the collection at Dacca
measure eight feet five inches, and eight feet three inches
respectively; and, to show that this is exceptional, Mr. Sanderson
measured one hundred and forty in 1874, and found
that the largest females measured just eight feet. Mistakes
and exaggerations occur from the fact that elephants are often
measured by throwing a tape over the shoulders, and, when
both ends touch the ground, accepting one-half as the correct
height: nine inches may be gained in this way in measuring
an eight-foot animal. Mr. Corse, a former superintendent of
the East India Company’s elephants at Tiperah, a province
of Bengal, who probably saw a greater number of elephants
than any European, states that he never heard of more than
one Asiatic elephant that exceeded ten feet. This was a
large tusker, the property of the Vizier of Oude. Accurate
measurements were made, which were as follows:—</p>

<p>Mr. Corse says, “During the war with Tippoo Sultan, of
the fifteen hundred elephants under the management of Capt.
Sandys, not one was ten feet high, and only a few males nine
and a half feet high.” He was very particular in ascertaining
the height of elephants used at Madras and in the army under
Marquis Cornwallis, from the fact that the most remarkable
stories were current at the time concerning large elephants.
Madras elephants were reported from fifteen to twenty feet
high. The Nabob of Dacca was said to have one, fourteen
feet in height; and Mr. Corse took a journey to the locality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
purposely to measure it. He found, that instead of twelve
feet, as he thought barely possible, the elephant was only ten.
If any of my readers wish to test the accuracy of any statement
as to an elephant’s height, they have only to measure
the distance around its foot twice, which will give nearly the
exact height at the shoulder. This is as deceptive as guessing
the height of a silk hat or the length of a horse’s head.
A party of young people were once watching some elephants,
when the question was propounded how many times around
the foot would equal the height. The answers were all over
ten, and one was fifteen. As the circumference of the fore-foot
of the average elephant is about fifty-four inches, this
would have given them an animal over sixty feet high. It
has been supposed by some authors, that elephants are not as
tall now as formerly, that they have degenerated in size
as the world grew older; but this is not borne out by facts.
The Emperor Baber (a contemporary of Henry VII.) says,
“They say in some islands about Hindostan, elephants grow
to the height of ten gez [about twenty feet]. I have never
seen one above four or five gez” [eight or ten feet].</p>

<p>The elephants from Hindostan are the smallest; those from
Pegu and Ava being larger, as a rule. A skeleton from the
latter country was presented to the Czar Peter by the King
of Persia; and the taxidermist managed to give it a height,
when mounted in the museum at St. Petersburg, of sixteen
and a half feet.</p>

<p>Among the natives of the elephant country, there are
many curious superstitions concerning the age, death, and
final resting-place of the great animal. The age to which
they may possibly attain is a matter of conjecture. One
hundred and fifty years is considered the limit by persons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
who are familiar with the subject. Expert native hunters
state that they live one hundred and twenty years, or
average about eighty. Mr. Sanderson expresses the belief
that they attain one hundred and fifty years, and bases his
conclusions from his observations of the famous elephant
Bheemruttee, owned by his Highness the Mahárájah of Mysore.
It was captured in Coorg in 1805, and was then a
baby elephant three years old. In 1876 she was in her prime,
and did not show any of the evidences of age evinced by elephants
that were known to be advanced in years; and, when
it is remembered that in captivity the animals are often ill-fed
and abused, it is evident that they may attain a great age.
Natives can determine the age of an Asiatic elephant within
a few years. They easily ascertain that of a young or very
old animal, but those of middle age present more difficulties.
The head of an old elephant is lean and rugged, the bones
of the skull being prominent, the eyes and temples sunken;
while the fore-legs, instead of bulging out at the knees,
present the same general size throughout. An old elephant
also has a different gait from a young one: instead of putting
the foot firmly upon the ground, the heel touches it first.
The surest test to the native, however, is the ear, which is
almost as conclusive a telltale as are the teeth of a horse.
In elephants not older than seven years, the top of the ear is
not turned over at the rim; but, as they grow older, it begins
to lap and curve, increasing with age; and in very old animals,
the lower portion is always torn and jagged. Elephants
attain their full growth at about twenty-five years of age, and
are in full vigor at thirty-five.</p>

<p>The Strologas, a tribe of the Billiga-rungun hills, assert
and believe that the elephant never dies; while the Kurrabas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
of Kákankoté, and many others, are firm in the belief that
they have some secret place to which they retire to die.
When this idea is scouted as romance by a European, the
native invariably asks, “Did you ever see a dead elephant?
Did you ever hear of any one who did?” and the questioner
and doubter is obliged generally to answer in the negative.
Not only have few sportsmen found an elephant that had
evidently died a natural death, but few natives have ever
seen one.</p>

<p>In all his rambles, covering nearly twenty years in the heart
of the elephant country, Mr. Sanderson never found an elephant
that had died a natural death, nor did he ever meet
with a professional native elephant-hunter who had, except
during an epidemic among the animals in the Chittagong
forest. This seems extremely remarkable when it is remembered
that, while the flesh might be devoured, the bones and
tusks would last a long time. The same belief is entertained
by the wild tribes of Ceylon. Sir Emerson Tennent says,
“The natives generally assert that the body of a dead elephant
is seldom or never discovered in the woods, and certain
it is, that frequenters of the forest with whom I had conversed,
whether European or Singhalese, alike are consistent
in their assurances that they have never found the remains
of a dead elephant that had died a natural death. One chief,
the Wanyyah of the Trincomalie district, told a friend of
mine, that, once after a severe murrain which had swept the
province, he found the carcasses of elephants that had died
of the disease. On the other hand, a European gentleman,
who for thirty-six years without intermission had been living
in the jungle, ascending to the summits of mountains in the
prosecution of the trigonometrical survey, and penetrating valleys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
in tracing roads, and opening means of communication,—one,
too, who has made the habits of the wild elephant a subject
of constant study and observation,—has often expressed
to me his astonishment that, after seeing many thousands of
living elephants in all possible situations, he had never yet
found a single skeleton of a dead one, except those which
had fallen by a rifle.” The Singhalese have a superstition in
relation to the close of life in the elephant. They believe
that, on feeling the approach of dissolution, he repairs to a
solitary valley, and there resigns himself to death. A native
who accompanied Mr. Cripps, when hunting in the forests of
Anarájapoora, intimated to him that he was then in the
immediate vicinity of the spot “to which the elephants come
to die,” but that it was so mysteriously concealed, that,
although every one believed in its existence, no one had ever
succeeded in penetrating it. At the corral of Kornegalle in
1847, one of the Kandyan chiefs assured him that it was
the universal belief of his countrymen, that the elephants,
when about to die, resorted to a valley in an unknown spot
among the mountains to the east of Adams Peak, which
was reached by a narrow pass with walls of rock on each
side, and that here, by the side of a lake of clear water, they
took their last repose. While this belief is held by some
natives of Continental India, there is not a spot in the
elephant country that has not been penetrated by either
Europeans or natives; yet the latter are not convinced, and
the mystery as to what becomes of the dead elephants is as
deep as ever. The elephants that die in captivity are victims
to the same troubles that affect all animals, and the wild
elephant is probably no exception. At the commissariat at
Bengal, one hundred and fourteen elephants died in 1874-75.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Eleven died of apoplexy, three of dysentery, five of inflammation
of the lungs, thirteen of debility, one of cold, twenty-six
of zahirbad, one of vomiting, three of colic, and one of
congestion of the brain,—abundant proof to the superstitious
native that the elephant is susceptible to dissolution.
Ceylon elephants are remarkable for the numbers born without
tusks. These are called mucknas, and differ in no other
respect from the elephants of Continental India. They
resemble ordinary females; the tusks being extremely small,
and useless as defence. Sometimes they are larger than
ordinary tuskers; but this may be mere accident, as is their
dental defect, and it is not an hereditary trait. So rare is a
good tusker in Ceylon, that one is looked upon as a curiosity.
Sir Samuel Baker states that not over one in three hundred
possessed them; and to show the difference between these
and the continental elephant, out of one hundred and forty,
fifty-one of which were males, captured by Mr. Sanderson in
Mysore, Bengal, in 1874-76, only five were mucknas, or tuskless.
We should expect to find theories at least to explain
this strange difference in an adjoining country, where the climate
and food conditions are almost identical (the food in
Ceylon is easier to obtain); but I am not aware that any of
importance have been expressed.</p>

<p>As large and powerful as the elephant is, it is easily dismayed
and alarmed; and many have an especial aversion to
small animals. Thus, some elephants have a great dislike
for small dogs; and a mouse has been known to cause a large
tusker to snort with fear. Wild hogs are particularly disagreeable
to the great animals, and it appears that this was
known to the ancients; as Procopius, the historian of the
Persian and Gothic wars, states that at the siege of Edessa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
by Chosroes, the king of Persia, in the time of Justinian, the
besieged Greeks imitated the cry of the pig to frighten the
elephants of the enemy. In fact, elephants are like other
animals. They have their likes and dislikes; and their
alarm at a mouse, in justice to some of the human race,
should not be used, as it often is, as an argument in proof
of their supposed cowardice and lack of intelligence.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE ELEPHANT.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In determining the intelligence of an animal, we naturally
take ourselves as the type of mental excellence, and grade
the lower animals as they approach us. Some would place
the ant next to man, arguing that it more closely resembles
him in its habits, customs, and methods of showing
what we consider the result of intelligent action. It keeps
domestic animals (<i>aphis</i>), goes to war in organized bodies,
makes slaves of other insects, erects wonderful structures, is
accredited with planting seeds, and certainly stores them up
after arranging them so that they cannot sprout; in fact,
appears to act in many ways like a rational human being:
and, contrasted to it, the elephant, dog, horse, and beaver
would seem to be comparatively stupid animals; at least,
such would be the verdict of the observer who mistakes
instinct for reason. Such a comparison seems unfair to
the other animals mentioned; and to argue that the elephant
is not as intelligent as the ant because it does not
build a house, and lay up a food-supply, would hardly be
just, as the great proboscidian does not require such shelter:
and, without instancing any more examples, it would
appear, that, to establish the relative intelligence of an
animal, it should be judged, not especially by the standard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
of another, but according to its displayal of what we term
thought; and this leads us to consider how thought may
be exhibited in an animal. Instinctive action is something
that is done without appreciable thought: thus, a
colt instinctively kicks at an enemy, as a kitten spits at
a dog. The fear of this animal has been present in all the
generations of cats, and is inherited, as shown by the protest
in the curve of the back, the raising of the tail, and other
familiar methods of expression. So we may, without multiplying
instances, consider that instinctive action is the outward
expression of inherited experience, and has practically
nothing in common with that action of the mind which we
call thought. If this kitten when it grows older,—and I
know of an instance,—should without instruction climb
upon a door, and lift the latch, she would be exhibiting a
practical illustration of the results of thought: in other
words, she would lift the latch because she knew that the
door could not be opened without it, and consequently had,
in her feline mind, turned over to some extent the relations
that existed between the latch, the door, and the object she
had in view. So if the colt should go to a pump, as a cow
is alleged to have done, and take the handle in its mouth
without being taught, and pump water to drink, it would
show that the animal had used its powers of thought. Now,
what position does the elephant take in the scale of intelligence?</p>

<p>The Hindoos of the present day do not consider the
elephant a remarkably intelligent animal. Yet at one time
its sagacity was certainly appreciated, as the Hindoo god of
wisdom is figured with the body of a man and the head of an
elephant; and A. W. Schlegel states that in very early times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
they marvelled at every thing about the animal, especially
its sagacity, which made it seem to them the embodiment of
the god Ganessa.</p>

<p>Probably Dr. Dalton expresses the latest knowledge touching
this subject. He says,—</p>

<p>“If we examine the comparative development of the hemispheres
of the brain in different species of animals, and in
different races of men, we shall find that the size of these
ganglia corresponds very closely with the degree of intelligence
possessed by the individual.... Among quadrupeds,
the elephant has much the largest, and most perfectly formed,
cerebrum, in proportion to the size of the entire body; and,
of all quadrupeds, he is proverbially the most intelligent
and the most teachable. It is important to observe, in this
connection, that the kind of intelligence which characterizes
the elephant and some other of the lower animals, and which
most nearly resembles that of man, is a <i>teachable</i> intelligence,—a
very different thing from the intelligence which depends
upon instinct, such as that of insects, for example, or birds of
passage.”</p>

<p>In a previous chapter I mentioned that Mr. H. H. Cross
informed me that he had seen an elephant of the Barnum
herd select a stick, and probe the small orifice in the temple.
Since then I have seen a statement by Mr. Cross in print, to
the effect that he has seen the elephant select a twig, examine
it carefully with one of its keen little eyes, by holding it up
in its trunk, and, if it found it was not sharp enough for the
purpose, deliberately grind down the point by rubbing it
upon a stone, and, when its shape suited him, use it to open
the orifice.</p>

<p>In Africa, according to Drummond, the wild elephants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
migrate south in time for certain fruits, which shows that
they must remember the pleasures of the past season. The
migration is not suggested by a lack of food, as the supply
of mimosa and other trees does not give out. When a wild
elephant takes a branch in its trunk, and uses it to brush
away flies, it shows more intelligence than it is generally
given credit for; while its lodging dust and sand on its back
to prevent the attack of these pests, is also to be considered
an intelligent act. Elephants are extremely cautious, and
this has been used as an argument against their intelligence.
Sanderson says that the animal is stupid because the simplest
fence is often sufficient to protect grain from them; but I
am inclined to think that this is owing to their extreme
caution: the fence may have in their mind some association
with the pitfall, or traps of some kind, which have been met
in their experience. An elephant will rarely step upon a
bridge that is not safe, and many instances could be cited
showing that their protests and objections were founded
upon an intelligent appreciation of danger. Sanderson says
also that the elephant lacks originality: but the two instances
I have mentioned,—namely, using a branch to brush off flies,
and sharpening the stick,—will, I think, in the opinion of my
young readers, free the great animal from this imputation;
and I do not recall many actions performed by <i>wild</i> animals,
that show more appreciation of the practical application of
cause and effect. The intelligence of the elephant has been
a subject of varied appreciation. Many observers have considered
remarkable actions of elephants involuntary, when
in truth they were merely obeying the commands of their
riders or mahouts, who expressed their wishes by the pressure
of their legs, or by the voice, which was not seen or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
heard by the observer. When Tavernier was travelling with
the Mahommedan army of the Mogul, he was astonished to
see the elephants seize the little images which stood before
the pagodas, and dash them to the ground. The Hindoos
readily believed that the elephant did this from a religious
aversion to the idols, but the traveller knew that the
mahouts were secretly directing the great animals. So, in
passing in review before the king, the elephants did not
salute until coming to his majesty.</p>

<p>Once when two elephants were at a spring, the largest
violently seized a bucket carried by the smaller, and began to
dip up water; upon which the other elephant drew back, and
butted its companion so that it fell headlong into the pool.
This story is told to illustrate the revengeful nature of the
animal, when, in point of fact, the entire action was instigated
by the mahout upon its back. The most remarkable
trait of the elephant is its obedience: and if we were to take
its aptitude to learn the tasks described in the chapter on
trained elephants, as a test of intelligence, it would certainly
hold its own among all animals; as, considering that it is
perhaps the most ungainly, and certainly the heaviest, of all
land animals, its various feats are indeed remarkable.</p>

<p>At the slightest pressure of its rider’s foot it will salute,
lift the trunk in the air, and trumpet loudly; stop, back, lie
down to enable the mahout to dismount, roll over, lift the
man upon its trunk, pass over his body with the greatest
ease, lift stones from the ground for the driver to throw at
other elephants, and even tie itself up at night; in fact,
among all trained animals, dogs, horses, or birds, none compare
with the elephant in their obedience, and intelligent
appreciation of what is required. Though “playing ’possum”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
or feigning death can hardly be cited as an evidence of intelligence,
it may be interesting to know that it is sometimes
attempted by elephants. Sir Emerson Tennent was informed
by Mr. Cripps that he was aware of an instance
where an elephant adopted this ruse to secure its freedom.
It had been led into a corral between two tame elephants,
and upon being released sank to the ground apparently lifeless.
Every attempt to revive it, or force it to show any
evidence of life, failed; and the natives believed that it had
died of a broken heart,—a term that they often apply when
an elephant dies without apparent cause. Finally the body
was abandoned as lifeless; and, as soon as the hunters had
gone a short distance, the wily brute regained its feet, and
rushed for the jungle, screaming at the top of its voice; its
cries of evident delight being heard long after it had disappeared.
In the various chapters of this work, other instances
have been cited showing that, far from being a stupid
animal, the elephant in its <i>wild</i> state exhibits far more intelligence
than the wild dog or horse; and when we compare
the animals after their so-called education, there is little that
the trained dog can do that is not accomplished by the elephant;
and while it is difficult to draw exact lines, and point
out the exact mental status of the elephant in the rank and
file of the lower animals, I would place it well to the front
among mammals.</p>

<p>I am glad to be able to bring to the support of my belief
in the superior intelligence of the elephant, the testimony of
a naturalist and careful observer, Col. Nicholas Pike, late
consul at Mauritius, whose extensive travels and long residence
in the East render his opinions of especial value and
interest. The following is Col. Pike’s letter in answer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
to my request for an expression of his opinion upon the
subject:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Mr. <span class="smcap">C. F. Holder</span>.</p>

<p><i>My dear Sir</i>,—In answer to your questions as to my opinion relative
to the intelligence of the elephant, I will jot down a few notes that may
interest you.</p>

<p>This animal is to my mind one of the most intelligent of the brute
creation. I am led to this conclusion from what I have actually seen,
and from reliable information given me by persons who have devoted a
lifetime to studying their habits and life-history generally. I think that
in elephants, as in other animals,—and we see even in man himself,—there
is a great difference in the amount of intelligence they possess.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, who owned many of these animals, placed an old
tame male that appeared sick, in a pasture, where he had also some horses
and sheep feeding, thinking it would recuperate “Dick,” who was a great
favorite. The whole pasture was well fenced in, and the gate was securely
bolted. One morning when I was visiting my friend, we were surprised
to see “Dick” let himself in by the back-gate; and he warned us of his
presence by trumpeting. His master went to him, and asked what he
wanted. The beast at once took up a pitcher containing water which
was near by, and poured some of it on the ground, attempting to sip a
few drops of it with his trunk. His master, seeing what he wanted, gave
him water, and told him to go back. Thinking the gate must have been
left open, and perhaps the sheep and horses straying out, we followed, but
to our surprise found the gate shut, and not only bolted, but the bolt
turned up in the little slot so that it should not be easily opened. We
waited, curious to see what Dick would do. As soon as he reached the
gate, he deliberately moved the bolt, and passed into the field, then turning
round, he re-adjusted the bolt as well as I could have done it, and
marched off contentedly to a favorite corner under some trees.</p>

<p>I have seen my friend quietly call individuals by their name out of the
herd; and in one instance, a female, “Maggie,” was called, and told to
take me on her back, which she did, helping me up carefully with her
trunk. I have seen an elephant draw a cork from a bottle of claret, and
drink the contents without spilling a drop. I saw four or five called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
singly by name from their grazing-ground, form in line, and bow, and
kneel before a group of ladies, and then march back in as regular order
at the word of command as a file of soldiers.</p>

<p>Hundreds of elephants are employed in the government service in the
three presidencies of India,—Calcutta, Bombay and Madras. They go
through a regular routine, and know their hours for work and recreation
as well as the man who watches the clock. When the bell sounds in the
morning, they take up their line of march, to the lumber-yards for instance,
where vast piles of beams and planks are stored. As soon as they
arrive, each takes up his work, left from the day before. Great logs and
beams are rolled along by the aid of the trunk, and, when near the pile,
are lifted, two elephants to each beam, and hoisted into place, when they
walk round and adjust their work with as much precision as a man would
use with a plumb-line. When the usual hour for quitting work arrives,
nothing can induce the creatures to go on; and you can’t fool them on the
time either, by ringing the bell late. Off they go to get their afternoon
bath, where they will lie and wallow in the muddy water for hours.
Their varied works require <i>cute</i> intelligence, not mere instinct, any more
than you can attribute the good paving of a roadway by a poor laborer,
who knows his business, though he may not be able to read or write, to
instinct.</p>

<p>A circumstance was related to me by my friend, Gen. E. W. de Lansing
Lowe, who was all through the campaign in India during the Sepoy
rebellion. He said he had a very intelligent elephant that he constantly
rode on, and as it was so hot they mostly travelled morning and evening.
During the war, they came about the dusk of evening to a small bridge
that spanned a deep ravine with water at the bottom. As soon as the
elephant came to this bridge, no inducement could make him cross it.
After some delay, finding all persuasion useless, the general determined
to examine the structure. They found the enemy had cut away the supports
of the bridge; and, had the elephant stepped on to it, the whole
party would have been precipitated into the gulf below.</p>

<p>We have a notable instance of the sagacity of these animals at the
time Barnum’s circus was in Bridgeport a few years ago. A fire broke
out in some sheds adjoining the tents, and it was feared the stables would
catch the flames. They began to pull down the sheds, when some one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
suggested to bring out two elephants. This was done, and the animals
set to with a will to pull down the place. They evidently at once took
in the situation. They not only tore down the place, but threw the timbers
so that they should not touch the tents, and beat out the flames.
Now, if this does not show almost human reason, what does? They
were put to the work on the spur of the moment, and not only performed
it as if used to it, but actually did it more intelligently than many men
would have done in such perilous circumstances. Had they not done so,
as water was short, the loss of life to man and beast, and of property,
might have been enormous.</p>

<p>If you could only interview Barnum, he could tell you more of the
intelligence of the elephant than any man living.</p>

<p>I could relate numerous other incidents I have seen and been informed
of; but enough has been said, I think, to prove how highly I think of the
intelligence, sagacity, or whatever other name you may give it, of this
unwieldly pachyderm.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE MAMMOTH.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In one of the old Chinese histories, there is a description
of a curious creature called <i>tyn-schu</i>, supposed to be a
subterranean, rat-like animal. It lived, according to the old
chroniclers, entirely beneath the ground; was as large as an
ox; and had enormous tusks, with which it threw up the
soil, or made its burrows; and the rumbling of earthquakes
was attributed to them. This was naturally considered a
fable by Europeans, but finally an English traveller was
shown a piece of the tusk. He found it to be ivory, and
suspected that the strange animal was a mammoth, as
indeed was the case. The bodies of these elephantine
giants were found in the far North, buried in the tundra;
and the simple Chinamen believed that they lived there,
and on their return from trading-trips told the story in the
South; and thus it became a part of their curious and, it
is needless to say, erroneous history.</p>

<p class="caption">MAMMOTH HUNT.</p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_36"><i>Page 36.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>The mammoth may rightly be considered the king of all
elephants, and in general appearance it much resembled the
African species. The full adult may have been a third more
bulky than the largest existing elephants, and undoubtedly
weighed at least twice as much. To protect them from the
cold, they were covered with hair, which gave them a ferocious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
appearance. The hair was of three kinds: first there
was a thick coat of reddish wool; over this grew a coat of
long, thick hair; while upon the neck was a heavy mane.
The tusks of the mammoth were enormous: some measured
thirteen feet in length; and, curved in a circle, gave the
animal a strange and formidable appearance.</p>

<p>While the mammoth greatly resembled the African elephant,
there are some points of difference. The skull is
narrower at the summit, and the molar teeth have great
breadth of crown as compared to the length: the ridges also
are narrow and crowded, while the enamel is thin and
straight, the crimping that is seen in others being absent.
The molars number, as in other elephants, eight, at one
time present; or, one and a portion of another one each side
of both jaws.</p>

<p>This huge elephant flourished principally in the far North;
and, as its remains are now found in the greatest abundance
on the shores of the Arctic Sea, it must have existed in vast
herds. The majority of specimens discovered are buried in
the soil, that is now frozen the year round in a solid mass
for many feet. The finest specimen known is a skeleton in
the museum at St. Petersburg; the original having been
discovered in 1799 by a poor fisherman named Schumachoff,
a Tongoose, who every spring followed down the Lena River
that led into the Arctic Sea. One day while engaged in following
his vocation, he observed on the side of a tundra a
shapeless mass, appearing like some huge monster entombed.
The following year he returned to the same locality, and
found that the object had weathered out still more, and was
a mammoth—a veritable frozen giant. Still, he could not
claim the fine tusks; and another year passed, and then his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
family were so superstitions that they refused to consent to
his again visiting the strange animal that he had described.
But finally, five years after his first trip, he determined to
again visit the scene of his discovery. He sailed down the
river in his small boat, and, with mingled emotions of fear
and curiosity, approached the imprisoned monster. Raising
his eyes on reaching the spot, he saw a great cavity in the
cliff, but the mammoth was gone. The ice had melted away,
but beneath where the giant had rested lay the enormous
body. The tusks were still intact; and Schumachoff carried
them South in triumph, where he realized fifty rubles from
the sale, leaving the body—which, wonderful to relate, was
as fresh as if the animal had died only a week before—to
the bears and wolves.</p>

<p>We could hardly expect a poor fisherman to know that it
was a valuable scientific discovery, and it was only by accident
that the story of the strange animal reached the scientific
world. Seven years later a Mr. Adams visited the spot,
where he found the mammoth still in the flesh, with the exception
of the fore-leg; and, even after this lapse of time, its
preservation was remarkable. The pupil of the eye was still
intact; and the brain rested in the cranium, the tissues being
so perfect that they could hardly be distinguished from those
of a living animal. During the interim between its fall upon
the beach and Mr. Adams’s visit, it had attracted numbers of
wild animals,—bears, foxes, etc.,—that devoured much of the
meat, that had been preserved for perhaps thousands of years.
The neck of the animal was still covered with a long mane;
and next to the skin was a thick brown wool, that was evidently
very valuable as a protection against the severe cold.
Much of the hair and wool of the huge creature was ground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
into the soil, but thirty pounds of this reddish wool was
recovered. Mr. Adams purchased the tusks, which were
nine feet in length; and finally the entire skeleton was
removed to St. Petersburg, where it may still be seen.</p>

<p>From the description and measurements of the skeleton,
Professor Ward has made a restoration of this ancient giant,
which gives a striking idea of the grandeur of its appearance.
(<a href="#plate3">See Plate III.</a>)</p>

<p>Dr. Pallas was the first to describe the mammoth with
scientific accuracy; and Blumenbach gave it its present
name, <i>Elephas primigenius</i>. In the northern countries it
ranged the forests at one time in vast numbers, being especially
common in England and Wales, where its remains are
generally found in caves and river-deposits. In Yorkshire
and Wales it was evidently followed by hyenas, that dragged
its bones into the caves. W. Boyd Dawkins says, that, in the
spring of 1866, he accompanied Mr. Antonio Brady to the
Uphall pit, England, and describes his finds as follows:—</p>

<p>“At the top, there was the surface-soil from one to three
feet deep; then an irregularly stratified layer of brick-earth
and gravel six feet; and lastly, an irregular layer of flint
gravel, underneath which was a fine reddish gray sandy loam,
four feet thick. All these had been cleared away, leaving
a platform exposed, on which was a most remarkable accumulation
of bones carefully left <i>in situ</i> by the workmen.
On the right hand was a huge tusk of mammoth, eight feet
long, with the spiral curvature undisturbed by the pressure
of the superadjacent strata. Across it lay a remarkably fine
antler of red deer. At a little distance was the frontal portion
of the skull of a urns, with its horn-cores perfect to the
very tips; while around, bones of various animals were scattered,—of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the <i>Rhinoceros hemitœchus</i>, mammoth, urus, horse,
either brown or grisly bear, and wolf. As we gazed down
on this tableau, we could not doubt for a moment that the
bottom of an ancient river with all its contents lay before
our eyes,—a river in which all these animals had been
drowned, and by which they had been swept into the exact
position which they then occupied. This inference was confirmed
by the examination of the thin layer of sandy gravel
on which they rested, for it was full of the shells of <i>Corbicula
fluminalis</i>, with the valves together just as in life.
There were also specimens of the common anodon of our
rivers, and of the <i>Helix nemoralis</i> of our hedge-rows. On a
continuation of the same platform, now cut away, the skull
of a mammoth was discovered in 1864, perfect, with the
exception of the tusks, which had been broken away, with
their incisive alveoli. That of the right side lay twenty feet
away from the skull, while the left has not yet been discovered.
Owing to the surprising skill of Mr. Davies, the skull
and tusk were taken up and re-united, and now constitute by
far the finest specimen of mammoth in the British Museum.
In some cases, the mammoth remains have not been deposited
by a river. At Lexden, near Colchester, as the Rev. O.
Fisher well observes, they were overwhelmed in a bog, the
small bones of the feet being found in their natural position,
a fact which shows that they sank feet foremost through the
peat into the subjacent clay.”</p>

<p>That the sea has greatly encroached upon the land of
England, and that the old grazing-grounds of the mammoth
are now under water, is evident from the fact that the teeth
of elephants are often dredged up by fishermen; and ivory-hunters
in some localities have literally fished for these teeth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
with drag-nets. A tusk dredged at Scarborough was as
fresh as when the animal was alive, and was cut up and used
for the various purposes to which ivory is put.</p>

<p>In its day, the mammoth also wandered through the forests
of France, and to the south as far as Rome. Portions of
its skeleton have been found in the volcanic gravel of Ponte
Molle and Monte Sacro, a fact showing that it flourished
here when the site of Rome was a bed of lava that flowed
from the volcanoes of Central Italy.</p>

<p>Germany was a famous grazing-ground for the mammoth.
At Seilberg near Constadt on the Necker, a heap of thirteen
tusks and teeth were found “heaped close upon each other,”
as if they had been packed artificially. A like find was
made in the village of Thiede, four miles south of Brunswick:
in a heap of soil ten feet square, there were found
eleven tusks, one eleven and another fourteen and three-quarters
feet long; thirty molar teeth, and numbers of large
bones; “mixed with these were the bones and teeth of rhinoceros,
horse, ox, and stag; they all lay mixed confusedly
together; none of them were rolled or much broken; and
the teeth, for the most part, separate and without the jaws:
there were also some horns of stag.”</p>

<p>The borders of the Arctic were, however, the favorite
pasturage for these giants; and the store of ivory there may
be said to be practically inexhaustible, though the trade in
the tusks has been going on with the Jakuti and Tungusians
from time immemorial.</p>

<p>The Siberian islands are a favorite locality for collectors,
where the tusks have been found protruding from the sand
in vast numbers. After Adams, the most valuable find was
made by Dr. Middendorf, a famous Siberian explorer, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
1843. It was discovered in latitude 66° 30´, between the Obi
and Yenesei, near the Arctic circle. Shortly after, the body
of a young one was found in a bed of sand and gravel fifteen
feet or so above the sea, near the river Taimyr; and in the
former the eye was so perfectly preserved, that the bulb,
now in the St. Petersburg museum, looks as though it had
been taken from a recent animal.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting mammoth discoveries in late
years was made by a young Russian engineer named Benkendorf,
who was employed in 1846 by the government to
survey the coast off the mouth of the Lena and Indigirka
rivers. The discovery is of such great interest and value,
that I give it in his own words, the account being an
abstract from a letter written to a friend in Germany:—</p>

<p>“In 1846 there was unusually warm weather in the north
of Siberia. Already in May unusual rains poured over the
moors and bogs, storms shook the earth, and the streams
carried not only ice to the sea, but also large tracts of land
thawed by the masses of warm water fed by the southern
rains.... We steamed on the first favorable day up the
Indigirka, but there were no thoughts of land: we saw
around us only a sea of dirty brown water, and knew the
river only by the rushing and roaring of the stream. The
river rolled against us trees, moss, and large masses of peat,
so that it was only with great trouble and danger that we
could proceed. At the end of the second day, we were only
about forty wersts up the stream. Some one had to stand
with the sounding-rod in hand continually, and the boat
received so many shocks that it shuddered to the keel. A
wooden vessel would have been smashed. Around us we
saw nothing but the flooded land. For eight days we met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
with the like hinderances, until at last we reached the place
where our Jakuti were to have met us. Farther up was a
place called Ujandina, whence the people were to have come
to us; but they were not there, prevented evidently by the
floods. As we had been here in former years, we knew the
place. But how it had changed! The Indigirka, here about
three wersts wide, had torn up the land, and worn itself a
fresh channel; and, when the waters sank, we saw, to our
astonishment, that the old river-bed had become merely that
of an insignificant stream. This allowed me to cut through
the soft earth; and we went reconnoitring up the new stream,
which had worn its way westward. Afterwards we landed
on the new shore, and surveyed the undermining and destructive
operation of the wild waters, that carried away, with
extraordinary rapidity, masses of soft peat and loam. It
was then that we made a wonderful discovery. The land on
which we were treading was moorland, covered thickly with
young plants. Many lovely flowers rejoiced the eye in the
warm beams of the sun, that shone for twenty-two out of
the twenty-four hours. The stream rolled over, and tore up
the soft, wet ground like chaff: so that it was dangerous to
go near the brink. While we were all quiet, we suddenly
heard under our feet a sudden gurgling and stirring, which
betrayed the working of the disturbed water. Suddenly our
jäger, ever on the lookout, called loudly, and pointed to a
singular and unshapely object, which rose and sank through
the disturbed waters. I had already remarked it, but not
given it any attention, considering it only drift-wood. Now
we all hastened to the spot on the shore, had the boat drawn
near, and waited until the mysterious thing should again
show itself. Our patience was tried: but at last, a black,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
horrible, giant-like mass was thrust out of the water; and we
beheld a colossal elephant’s head, armed with mighty tusks,
with its long trunk moving in the water in an unearthly manner,
as though seeking for something lost therein. Breathless
with astonishment, I beheld the monster hardly twelve feet
from me, with his half-open eyes yet showing the whites. It
was still in good preservation.</p>

<p>“‘A mammoth! a mammoth!’ broke out the Tschernomori;
and I shouted, ‘Here, quickly! chains and ropes!’ I will
go over our preparations for securing the giant animal, whose
body the water was trying to tear from us. As the animal
again sank, we waited for an opportunity to throw the ropes
over his neck. This was only accomplished after many
efforts. For the rest we had no cause for anxiety; for, after
examining the ground, I satisfied myself that the hind-legs
of the mammoth still stuck in the earth, and that the waters
would work for us to unloosen them. We therefore fastened
a rope round his neck, threw a chain round his tusks, that
were eight feet long, drove a stake into the ground about
twenty feet from the shore, and made chain and rope fast to
it. The day went by quicker than I thought for; but still,
the time seemed long before the animal was secured, as it
was only after the lapse of twenty-four hours that the water
had loosened it. But the position of the animal was interesting
to me: it was standing in the earth, and not lying on
its side or back as a dead animal naturally would, indicating,
by this, the manner of its destruction. The soft peat or
marsh land, on which he stepped thousands of years ago,
gave way under the weight of the giant; and he sank as he
stood on it, feet foremost, incapable of saving himself; and
a severe frost came, and turned him into ice and the moor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
which had buried him. The latter, however, grew and flourished,
every summer renewing itself. Possibly the neighboring
stream had heaped over the dead body plants and sand.
God only knows what causes had worked for its preservation.
Now, however, the stream had brought it once more to the
light of day; and I, an ephemera of life compared with this
primeval giant, was sent here by Heaven just at the right
time to welcome him. You can imagine how I jumped for
joy.</p>

<p>“During our evening meal, our posts announced strangers:
a troop of Jakuti came on their fast, shaggy horses; they
were our appointed people, and were very joyful at sight of
us. Our company was augmented by them to about fifty
persons. On showing them our wonderful capture, they
hastened to the stream; and it was amusing to hear how
they chattered and talked over the sight. The first day I
left them in quiet possession; but when, on the following,
the ropes and chains gave a great jerk, a sign that the mammoth
was quite freed from the earth, I commanded them to
use their utmost strength, and bring the beast to land. At
length, after much hard work, in which the horses were
extremely useful, the animal was brought to land; and we
were able to roll the body about twelve feet from the shore.
The decomposing effect of the warm air filled us all with
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Picture to yourself an elephant with a body covered with
thick fur, about thirteen feet in height, and fifteen in length,
with tusks eight feet long, thick, and curving outward at
their ends, a stout trunk of six feet in length, colossal limbs
of one and a half feet in thickness, and a tail, naked up to
the end, which was covered with thick, tufty hair. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
animal was fat, and well grown. Death had overtaken him
in the fulness of his powers. His parchment-like, large,
naked ears lay fearfully turned up over the head. About
the shoulders and the back he had stiff hair, about a foot in
length, like a mane. The long, outer hair was deep brown,
and coarsely rooted. The top of the head looked so wild,
and so penetrated with pitch (<i>und mit Pech so durchgedrungen</i>),
that it resembled the rind of an old oak-tree. On the
sides it was cleaner (<i>reiner</i>); and under the outer hair, there
appeared everywhere a wool, very soft, warm, and thick, and
of a fallow-brown color. The giant was well protected
against the cold. The whole appearance of the animal was
fearfully strange and wild. It had not the shape of our
present elephants. As compared with our Indian elephants,
its head was rough, the brain-case low and narrow, but the
trunk and mouth were much larger. The teeth were very
powerful. Our elephant is an awkward animal; but, compared
with this mammoth, it is as an Arabian steed to a
coarse, ugly dray-horse. I could not divest myself of a feeling
of fear as I approached the head. The broken, widely
open eyes gave the animal an appearance of life, as though
it might move in a moment, and destroy us with a roar....
The bad smell of the body warned us that it was time to
save of it what we could; and the swelling flood, too, bid us
hasten. First of all, we cut off the tusks, and sent them to
the cutter. Then the people tried to hew the head off; but,
notwithstanding their good will, this was slow work. As
the belly of the animal was cut open, the intestines rolled
out; and then the smell was so dreadful, that I could not
overcome my nauseousness, and was obliged to turn away.
But I had the stomach separated, and brought on one side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
It was well filled, and the contents instructive and well preserved.
The principal were young shoots of the fir and
pine: a quantity of young fir-cones, also in a chewed state,
were mixed with the mass.... As we were eviscerating the
animal, I was as careless and forgetful as my Jakuti, who
did not notice that the ground was sinking under their feet,
until a fearful scream warned me of their misfortune, as I
was still groping in the animal’s stomach. Shocked, I sprang
up, and beheld how the river was burying in its waves our
five Jakuti and our laboriously saved beast. Fortunately
the boat was near, so that our poor work-people were all
saved; but the mammoth was swallowed up by the waves,
and never more made its appearance.”</p>

<p>This mammoth had undoubtedly strayed into a morass,
and been ingulfed; and soon after, or before the body had
an opportunity to decay, it had frozen up, to be released
again ages after by an unusual thaw.</p>

<p>The most recent mammoth-hunt has been made by Dr.
Bunge, who instituted a search along the Lena delta, finding,
I believe, but one specimen, which was without its head and
one fore-leg. It had been exposed for ten years to the attack
of foxes, native dogs, and the natives themselves, and was
well-nigh ruined.</p>

<p>The mammoth was not confined to the Old World. Vast
quantities of bones have been found in Escholtz Bay in a
peaty deposit that rests on a cliff of pure blue ice, and in
various parts of America. As to the causes that led to its
extinction, they are equally problematical. In Kentucky,
Ohio, and Central North America, there would seem to have
been every thing to favor its continuance,—an abundance of
food, and vast areas to range upon. The one agency that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
might have produced its extermination is the one now at
work upon its ally in Africa, namely, man. There is little
doubt that the early Americans chased the great animal, and,
hunted from one part of the country to another, they finally
entirely disappeared.</p>

</div>

<p>Though to-day we look to Asia and Africa for elephants,
and consider the huge proboscidians as extremely un-American,
they originally roamed this country in vast herds,
and were as common on our plains and prairies as are many
animals of the present day. The mastodon, in the estimation
of many naturalists, existed up to five hundred years
ago; and, judging from the apparent freshness of the remains,
there is no great objection to the belief. They were undoubtedly
hunted by the ancestors of the mound-builders and early
tribes; and, while other agencies may have aided in their
extermination, the aboriginal hunter was an all-powerful
factor, the result being no more remarkable than that going
on at present in the extermination of the bison. What sights
the early American boys and girls must have witnessed,
assuming this to have been the case! The mighty mastodons,
with their huge bodies and pillar-like legs, presented
a far more impressive spectacle than the largest elephant of
to-day; and when a captive giant was brought in, or found
mired in a bog, what shouts and cries arose from these children,
perhaps, of the mound-builders!</p>

<p>The tusks of the mastodon were marvels of beauty. Those
of some species were straight, turning only at the tips: others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
had three tusks, two in the upper jaw, and one in the lower,
the latter ordinarily of small size, though occasionally they
attained large dimensions. Some individuals had four of
these ivory weapons, giving them a strange and ferocious
appearance.</p>

<p>The discovery that mastodons existed in America at one
time, was made over a hundred years ago. In 1714 Dr.
Cotton Mather of Boston forwarded a paper to the Royal
Society of London, describing some mastodon bones, and
endeavoring to prove that they were those of some giant
mentioned in Holy Writ. The mastodon he referred to was
discovered near Albany in 1705; and some of the grinders,
or teeth, weighed four pounds. Thirty-five years later, a
French officer, named Longueil, while travelling through
what is now the State of Ohio, found near the Ohio River
in a swamp a number of bones and tusks. Some of these
were carried to Paris. In 1763 Mr. George Croghan, an
Englishman, made a valuable find of mastodon remains near
the celebrated Big Bone Lick of Kentucky. It was estimated
that the finds represented the remains of thirty individuals.
Some of the tusks which were found about six feet
from the surface were seven feet in length.</p>

<p>The next important discovery was made on the Walkill
River, about seventy miles from New York, by the Rev.
Robert Annan. The bones were found in digging a ditch;
and, from their position, it was evident that the huge animal
had died standing, or had been mired, and so met its death.
In 1805 Bishop Madison of Virginia communicated to “The
Scientific World” the discovery of some mastodon bones that
were found about five feet beneath the ground. This find
was extremely interesting and valuable; as with the body, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
in a position which represented the stomach of one of the
skeletons, was found a mass of ground and bruised vegetation,
which upon analysis showed that it was made up of
grass, shrubs, and leaves, and of a species of rose still growing
in Virginia. The Indians, who, it seems, made the discovery,
stated that among these there was one that flesh still
adhered to, and that it had a long nose.</p>

<p>Quite a number of Indian tribes have traditions concerning
animals with a long nose, or trunk. The most familiar is that
of the Delaware tribe, and the following is the statement
that the natives claim to have been handed down by their
ancestors: “That in ancient times a herd of these tremendous
animals came to the Big Bone Licks, and began a
universal destruction of the bear, deer, elks, buffaloes, and
other animals, which had been created for the use of the
Indians; that the Great Man above, looking down, and seeing
this, was so enraged that he seized his lightning, descended
on the earth, seated himself on a neighboring mountain on a
rock, on which his seat and the print of his feet are still to
be seen, and hurled his bolts among them till the whole were
slaughtered, except the big bull, who, presenting his forehead
to the shafts, shook them off as they fell; but, missing one
at length, it wounded him in the side; whereon, springing
round, he bounded over the Ohio, over the Wabash, the
Illinois, and finally over the Great Lakes, where he is living
at this day.”</p>

<p>Mastodon tusks and remains have been unearthed in
various parts of the State of California, showing that the
huge elephants roamed over the entire continent just as the
African elephant originally did on that continent. In California
the remains of the mastodon have been found associated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
with human bones, stone implements, the remains of
the elephant, tapir, bison, and modern horse. Mr. Stickney,
the well-known Indian agent, states that “particular persons
in every nation were selected as the repositories of their
history and traditions; that these persons had others who
were younger, selected for this purpose continually, and repeatedly
instructed in those things which were handed down
from generation to generation; and that there was a tradition
among the Indians of the existence of the mastodon;
that they were often seen; that they fed on the boughs of
a species of lime-tree; and that they did not lie down, but
leaned against a tree to sleep.”</p>

<p>Some tribes are familiar with such remains, and call them
“fathers of oxen,” and state that they lived long years ago
with a race of gigantic men, and that the Great Spirit killed
them all with fire-bolts.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Barton, in 1761 there were found by
Indians in this country five huge carcasses with long noses
above their mouths; but this lacks satisfactory proof. In
some of the ancient carvings in Mexico and Yucatan, especially
those at Palenque, representations of an elephant’s
head are to be seen; and it is assumed that the artists must
have been acquainted with the animals, or have had some
tradition concerning them. Mr. Latrobe relates that “near
the city of Tezcuco, one of the ancient roads or causeways
was discovered; and on one side, only three feet below the
surface, in what may have been the ditch of the road, there
lay the entire skeleton of a mastodon. It bore every appearance
of having been coeval with the period when the
road was used.” An old Mexican hieroglyphic represents a
sacrificing priest with head covered with a casque, in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the head of an animal bearing a striking resemblance to the
elephant may be seen. The trunk is too distinct and plain
to be an accidental resemblance; and the artist did not have
the tapir in view when he produced it, the head being decidedly
elephantine.</p>

<p>Professor Holmes found the bones of the mastodon associated
with pottery on the banks of the Ashley River, near
Charleston, S.C.; and, in the majority of these cases, the mastodon’s
remains were discovered very near the surface. Professor
Winchell states that he has himself “seen the bones
of the mastodon and elephant embedded in peat, at depths
so shallow that he could readily believe the animals to have
occupied the country during its possession by the Indians.”
The so-called elephant-mound, referred to in these pages,
is considered by some as evidence that the mastodon was a
familiar form to the early American; so with the Indian
pipes (<a href="#plate18">Plate XVIII.</a>). If they are intended to represent
elephants, which one can hardly doubt, the maker must
either have seen the mastodon, or have had it accurately
described to him. Quite recently some tracks, presumably
those of the mastodon or elephant, have been discovered on
the surface of a sandstone quarry at Carson City, in Nevada.
They represent a series of circular depressions from three to
six inches in depth, each about twenty inches in diameter,
which, according to the method of measuring the height of
elephants in India, would give an elephant ten feet high.
The impressions have been traced for forty feet, and show
distinct footprints giving a stride of about five feet eight
inches.</p>

<p>The largest find ever made in this country, with the exception
perhaps of the vast collection at the Big Bone Lick,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Kentucky, was that at Warren, N.J., in 1845, where no less
than six almost perfect skeletons were found six feet below
the surface. A farmer discovered them while digging out
mud from a small swamp; and, as most of the huge creatures
were standing upright, it is evident that they became mired
in the bog, and slowly sank into it. We can imagine the
scene when these six monsters were entrapped,—their trumpeting,
their roars of rage and fear, their mighty struggles to
escape, that, with their combined weight, only served to mire
them deeper and deeper, until they finally disappeared, to
remain entombed for untold ages, and to be finally found, and
placed in our museums and halls of science as monuments of
a lost race.</p>

<p>Nearly all the mastodons are found in swamps, showing
that possibly these morasses appeared to be veritable traps
that hastened the extinction of these monarchs of the forest.
This may be considered the popular theory of one method
by which mastodons were destroyed: but there is no better
authority than Professor James Hall, the present geologist in
chief of the State of New York; and his opinions are entirely
different. His views are, that the extinction of the
mastodon was hastened by the glacial period, and that most
of the remains discovered have been dropped in hollows or
ponds, from the ice perhaps, and the peat formed over them.
He advances in favor of this the fact that several tusks have
been discovered which show evidences of glacial action.
There is such a tusk in the collection of the Philadelphia
Academy of Sciences, worn by supposed glacial action; and
Rutgers College has the extremity of a tusk, showing what
is considered by Professor Hall to be glacial striæ.</p>

<p>Referring to the Big Bone Lick, Professor Hall says,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
“With our present knowledge, it would appear that this accumulation
of bones, teeth, and tusks of mastodon, in Kentucky,
may have been caused by the melting of a glacier in
which they had become embedded, and, being gradually
pushed forward to its southern limit, had been deposited in
this place. There are other similar localities of less importance
and extent, where mastodon remains have been obtained
in considerable numbers; and it is not improbable that
a critical examination of all known collections may furnish
some further evidence of conditions similar to those indicated
by the specimens in the Museums of the Philadelphia
Academy of Sciences and of Rutgers College.</p>

<p>“However heterodox these views may appear, as opposed
to the generally received opinions of the age and relations of
the mastodon, I feel quite sure that some other hypothesis
than the one usually entertained must be adopted in order to
arrive at a satisfactory explanation of the mode and conditions
of distribution and inhumation of the mastodon and
fossil elephant remains of this country.</p>

<p>“In advocating this opinion regarding the extermination of
the mastodon, I have reference to the remains as they have
come under my own observation: and I do not mean to be
understood as opposing <i>in toto</i>, the views so generally entertained,
that the mastodon has existed during the present
epoch; or that the opinion held by some of our scientists,
that the animal may have existed both before and since the
glacial period, is untenable. I refer only to the phenomena
usually accompanying these remains, and the conditions attending
those which have been exhumed within the State of
New York and adjacent parts of New Jersey, and to some
extent in other parts of the country. The locality of Big<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Bone Lick in Kentucky, which has furnished the fragmentary
parts of so many skeletons (and some other Western localities),
I have not visited; but the evidence already given in
relation to the bones from this place, indicates very clearly
that they had suffered from glacial action; and the animals
were, as we infer, of the glacial period.”</p>

<p>On the great Osage River, the mastodons were sunk in the
mud in a vertical position. Perhaps the most interesting find
in New-York State was what is known as the Cohoes mastodon.
In the fall of 1866 a number of workmen were employed
in excavating the foundation for the Harmony Mills
Company, in Cohoes; and after much labor, during which
several thousand loads of muck or peaty soil, and old trunks
of trees, had been removed, one of the men discovered the
jaw-bone of some gigantic animal. The bone was found almost
at the water-level, and at a depth of twenty-five feet below
the surface; the entire locality being clay and earth, which
formerly had been filled in to cover a swampy depression.</p>

<p>The report of the find was conveyed to Professor James
Hall, who immediately undertook the superintendence of the
search. He soon saw that the locality had at one time been
the bed of the river, and that the remains were evidently in
a vast pot-hole,—a circular pit often seen in the rock-borders
of rivers at the present day. The discovery of the jaw
pointed to the assumption that the entire skeleton could not
be far off, and careful search was immediately commenced.
Loads of refuse, old trunks of trees showing the imprint of
beavers’ teeth, broken slate, water-worn pebbles, were removed,
and finally, in the bottom of the great pot-hole, upon
a mass of material similar to that which had been taken out,
covered with river-ooze and vegetable soil, the principal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
parts of the great mastodon were found. First, the bones of
the hind-legs appeared, and a portion of the pelvis; and
against the sloping wall reclined the massive head with tusks
complete, unbroken and undisturbed; then followed many
of the other portions of the skeleton, all lodged in a pot-hole
of great depth. Sixty feet were explored without finding
bottom; and the supposition was, that the animal had in some
way been caught in a glacier, and gradually melted out as
the great mass of ice slowly moved down over the face of the
country, dropping it into this natural tomb. This complete
skeleton (<a href="#plate5">Plate V.</a>) was presented to the cabinet of the
State Museum at Albany, and is now on exhibition there,
one of the finest specimens in existence. Its dimensions
are as follows:—</p>

<p>In some of the mastodons found, remains of food have been
discovered between the ribs: thus it has been determined
that the huge creature existed when the country appeared
much as it does to-day. The <i>Mastodon giganteus</i> fed upon
the spruce and fir trees. The mastodons wandered over
almost every country known, and their remains are very
common in South America. Humboldt found them as far
north as Santa Fe de Bogota, and they have been discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
as far south as Buenos Ayres. Their range in South America
has been given from five degrees north to about thirty-seven
degrees south; and they were probably not restricted to this
area.</p>

<p>Like the elephants of the present day, they wandered to
great elevations, even up to the borders of perpetual snow;
and a tooth described by Cuvier was obtained by Humboldt,
in a volcano, at an elevation of seventy-two hundred feet
above the level of the sea. A fine collection of these South-American
mastodons is exhibited in the museum at Santiago.
They were found by a party of men in an attempt to drain
Lake Tagua in the province of Colchagua, about one hundred
miles south of Santiago, sixty from the Pacific, and
fourteen hundred feet above the sea. A ditch was cut, to
drain off the water; and, after it had been drawn off, the remains
of the great animal were seen lying upon the bottom.</p>

<p class="caption">COHOES MASTODON.</p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_57"><i>Page 57.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>With these mastodons, there existed in North America an
elephant, <i>E. Columbi</i>, which probably associated in herds with
the mastodon, but were not as large. The mastodons were
extremely ponderous, and exceeded the largest elephant of
to-day in size, and, though resembling them in general appearance,
differed in several marked features. The tusks
often grew in a peculiar manner: two large, nearly straight
ones appeared in the upper jaw, while one or two protruded
from the lower. As a rule, these lower incisors were small;
but in some instances they attained considerable size.
Imagine an elephant eleven or more feet in height, with
three or four enormous sharp ivory tusks, its trunk raised
aloft, rushing at an enemy! surely, such an animal was the
true king of beasts, even in these early days. The tusks
of the mastodons assumed many strange shapes, and a herd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
of these great creatures must have presented a curious appearance.
As in other proboscidians, the teeth consisted of
incisors and molars. In the <i>Mastodon turiensis</i> of the pliocene
time, found at Sismonda, the tusks of the upper jaw were
nearly straight, though bending their points toward each
other, long, sharp, and powerful. In a mastodon whose remains
were found in Ohio (<i>Mastodon Ohioticus</i>), the tusks
were long, gradually rising at the ends in a graceful curve;
while in the lower jaw appeared a small single tusk. These
lower incisors were present in the young of both sexes of
this species, but were soon shed by the female, one being
retained in the male; so that it was a three-tusked mastodon.
In the <i>Mastodon longirostris</i>, there were, besides the two upper
tusks, two long, slender tusks in the lower jaw, a defence
more formidable than that possessed by any animal of to-day.
In the elephant, the enamel is confined to the apex of the
tusks; but in the huge mastodons They often had longitudinal
bands of enamel, more or less spirally disposed upon their
surface. The molar or grinding teeth of the mastodons appeared,
much as in the elephants, in a horizontal succession:
the front or worn-out teeth were pushed out or lost before
the complete development of the posterior ones, which gradually
moved forward to take the place of those which were
worn out or ground away. The process was not as perfect
as that in the present elephant, described in chapter first;
as sometimes three teeth were in each jaw of the mastodon
at the same time. The teeth are the chief points of distinction
between the elephant and the mastodon; and they
are readily recognized by the grinding surfaces of the molars,
which have transverse ridges, their summits being divided into
conical cusps, with smaller ones often clustered about them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
The enamel is quite thick: the cementum, which is so plentiful
in the teeth of elephants, is very scanty, never filling
in the interspaces of the ridges; so that the teeth present a
serrated edge.</p>

<p>The great mastodon, many species of which are known,
lived during what is known as the miocene time of geology,
ranging from the middle of this period to the end of the
pliocene, in the Old World, when they appear to have become
extinct. In Ohio, the mastodons lived to a much later time,
surviving until the late pliocene period, and were, as I have
suggested, probably hunted by early man, if he was in existence
at that time.</p>

<p>The mastodons had a wide geographical range, being found
in almost every country. Nine species are known from
Europe,—<i>M. angustidens</i>, <i>M. borsoni</i>, <i>M. pentelici</i>, <i>M. pyrenaicus</i>,
<i>M. taperoides</i>, <i>M. virgatidens</i>, <i>M. avernensis</i>, <i>M. dissimilis</i>,
and <i>M. longirostris</i>. Five species have been found in
India, and four in North America. Two are from South
America. Two only have been found in England.</p>

<p>Mastodons undoubtedly lived in Australia; a molar tooth
of <i>M. andium</i>, or a similar form, having been found in New
South Wales.</p>

<p>From this brief review of the early proboscidians, it will be
seen that the elephant, as we popularly term all proboscidians,
had originally as wide a range as man, appearing in
almost every country; and it is even described by Pliny as
being very plentiful in the forests of the so-called Atlantis.</p>

<p class="tb">Equally as interesting as the huge mastodon was the pygmy
elephant, two species of which formerly existed. These were
remarkably diminutive creatures, about the size of ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
sheep; while their baby elephants must have been about that
of ordinary cats. We can imagine a herd of these wonderful
little creatures roaming about, and the strange appearance
they must have presented. Their names are <i>Elephas melittensis</i>
and <i>E. falconeri</i>; their bones are found in Malta and
various parts of Italy. Living small or pygmy elephants
are frequently referred to in old works. Bles, a correspondent
of Buffon, states that he saw one in the Kandyan
kingdom not larger than a heifer, and covered with hair.
Bishop Heber says, that, in his journey from Bareilly to the
Himalayas, he saw the Rájah Gourman Sing mounted on an
elephant hardly bigger than a Durham ox, and almost as
shaggy as a poodle.</p>

<p>It would seem that at one time a pygmy elephant existed
in the Philippines, perhaps when they were connected to the
Indian continent; as Professor Semper found the tooth of a
fossil species at Mindanao, on the upper course of the Agusan,
the most southerly of the group. The tooth, which this eminent
scientist considers to have belonged to a dwarf species
of the Indian elephant, was used in a remarkable ceremonial.
It was worn by the Baganis, or chiefs of a cannibal race, on
important occasions, strung about the neck with various
objects, as images of gods, crocodile-teeth, etc. When the
wearer in battle killed a foe, his breast was opened with a
sacred sword, and the tooth and associated objects were
dipped in the blood; and after the god of war, to which
these objects are sacred, was supposed to have slaked his
thirst, the Bagani indulged themselves in the human feast.</p>

<p>In the second book of the Æneid, Virgil refers to a tradition
that at one time Sicily was a part of the main-land; and
Malta was probably connected in a similar manner. Geologists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
even claim that Italy was united to Africa by a bridge
of land, over which various animals passed.</p>

<p>It would be extremely interesting to trace back the early
history of elephants, to follow their ancestry into the past,
as we can the horse; but the present state of knowledge
renders this difficult if not impossible. The present elephants
stand alone and distinct, without any living allies.
They are hoofed animals, in this related to the cows, etc.;
and in their structure they show some affinities with the
gnawing animals, or rodents; but here nearly all resemblances cease.
We may follow them back to ancient elephants
of the tertiary time, and to the era when mastodons
reigned, but we cannot show that they are descended from
the mastodons: in short, their history is shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>One of the earliest proboscidians was the dinotherium,
a remarkable animal larger than living elephants, with a
trunk, and an enormous head, the lower jaw of which was
armed with two powerful tusks which pointed downward, and
tended toward the body. This strange elephantine creature
lived in the upper miocene time, and has been found only in
Europe. It is supposed to have been a water-loving animal,
and to have uprooted trees and roots with the powerful tusks.
In the accompanying picture (<a href="#plate6">Plate VI.</a>), I have attempted
a restoration of the animal, which gives an idea of its general
appearance. The dinotherium ranged, as far as known, from
France to India, its southern limit in Europe being Greece
(Pikermi).</p>

<p>Some authors express the opinion that the singular group
of extinct animals known as dinocerata are ancestral forms
of the elephant. The various species of dinoceros were
animals of elephantine stature, but with shorter limbs; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
their heads could reach the ground, so that there was no
evident need of a proboscis. Indeed, certain animals may
have possessed trunks, and not been elephants, if we may
accept the restoration of Burmeister, who shows a pliocene,
horse-like animal,—<i>Macrauchenia patagonia</i>,—with a proboscis.</p>

<p>The head of the dinoceros must have presented a remarkable
appearance, being provided with two long, sharp, canine
teeth, and places for four horns. Whether the latter were
present, or not, is not known. All the species that are known
come from the Wyoming tertiary. In fact, the question is
involved in darkness. Professor Cope considers that they
all branched from some primitive stock in eocene times, and
at one time stated that the coryphodon, an animal as large
as an ox, with a wide elephantine pelvis, was a possible
ancestor; but now I believe he looks still farther back, to a
group he has termed <i>Taxepoda</i>.</p>

<p>Professor Schmidt of the University of Strasburg says,
“In entering upon a discussion of the elephants as a class,
it was our wish to do away with what mystery seemed to
encompass the existence of the present animal; and we have
done so by pointing out their undoubted descent from the
miocene mastodons.” The latter forms he considers to “have
originated from ancestors of the dinotherium species;” but
as to the ancestor of the dinotherium, the learned professor
leaves us in the dark as much as ever. It is only within a
few years that the genealogy of the horse has been regarded
as worked out; and it may be only a matter of time before
Cope, Marsh, Leidy, or others will present the world with
the original elephant.</p>

<p>Many elephants have become famous in ancient and
modern times,—some by their deeds in war (for their
courage and daring), others for their domestic virtues and
intelligence. But Jumbo, whose fame extended to all civilized
nations, was noted for his great size, and for the hue and
cry raised over his departure from their country by the
English people; and it is safe to say that no animal ever rose
to quite such a lofty pinnacle of popularity. Probably not
a boy or girl who visited the huge animal when alive, but
ever after took an interest in his career, and sincerely regretted
his untimely end. Jumbo was a prince among elephants,
a magnificent example of the possibilities of animal
life, and a type of a race that is slowly but surely passing
away. Jumbo’s early infancy was undoubtedly spent in the
wilds of Central Africa. In 1861, when he was about four
feet high, an elephantine toddler, Sir Samuel Baker saw him
in the possession of some Hamran Arabs, who were taking
him down the Settite River for delivery to a collector named
Johann Schmidt. The latter sold him to the Jardin des
Plantes; and Mr. W. B. Tegetmier says, “I saw him the day
after his arrival in the Gardens, and went into his den with
Mr. Bartlett. He was then about four feet high; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
keeper, holding a long-handled broom in the usual manner,
was scrubbing his back, which was far below him.” This
was in 1865: so that when he died, Jumbo was presumably
about twenty-six years old, hardly in his prime; and I learn
from Professor Ward, who mounted the skeleton, that he had
not ceased growing. From 1865 to 1882 Jumbo lived in the
Gardens of the London Zoölogical Society, pampered, fed,
and petted by old and young; daily being marched upon the
green with a load of children upon his back; and though, as
Sir Samuel Baker says, he was not designed by nature as a
perambulator, still the great animal was eminently successful
as one.</p>

<p class="caption">PLATE VI.</p>
<p class="caption">THE DINOTHERIUM. (<i>An extinct Elephant-like Creature.</i>)</p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_62"><i>Page 62.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>Whether founded on fact, it is difficult to say, but rumors
became current, that Jumbo had given evidence of dangerous
outbursts of temper; and the keepers were afraid, so the report
went, that possibly some one would be hurt. At this opportune
juncture, Mr. Barnum, through an agent, offered the
Zoölogical Society the sum of ten thousand dollars for Jumbo,
which was immediately accepted; and, before the astonished
public were hardly aware of what had occurred, the papers
were signed that placed Jumbo in American hands. When
this fact became known, there rose a clamor and protest from
all classes. The excitement grew daily, added to by the
comments of the German, English, and French press, until
the question of Jumbo was the all-absorbing topic of the
day. “The New-York Herald” said, “It seems a sad thought
that a war between England and America is imminent, and
may break out at any moment, and that no intervention will
be able to stay the angry passions of two nations which
ought to live in undisturbed harmony. The cause of this
possible outbreak is the thoughtless sale of Jumbo, the pet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
elephant. Mr. Barnum vows that he will exhibit the giant
to fifty millions of free Americans at fifty cents apiece. It
seems a pity to rupture the amicable relations that have so
long existed between us and our neighbors, but we must
have that elephant.”</p>

<p>Mr. Labouchere mentioned the matter in a humorous way
in Parliament; and “The London Standard” pathetically remarked,
“When a Southern slave-owner put in force his legal
right of separating a family at the auction-block, the world
rang with anathemas against the inhumanity of the deed.
Surely, to tear this aged brute from a home to which he is attached,
and from associates who have so markedly displayed
their affection for him, is scarcely less cruel.” Mr. Lowell,
our minister at the time, is said to have observed, that
the only burning question between the countries was
Jumbo.</p>

<p>Thousands now flocked to the Garden to see the now famous
elephant, that evidently had a strong hold upon their
affections; subscriptions were started, to buy him back at
any price; and the directors of the Garden were the butt of
a vast amount of abuse.</p>

<p>Finally the editor of “The London Daily Telegraph” sent
the following cablegram to Mr. Barnum:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">P. T. Barnum, New York.</span>—Editor’s compliments. All British
children distressed at elephant’s departure. Hundreds of correspondents
beg us to inquire on what terms you will kindly return Jumbo. Answer
prepaid, unlimited.</p>

<p class="right">LESARGE.</p>

</div>

<p>And back went this eminently characteristic reply from
the great American showman:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My compliments to editor “Daily Telegraph” and British nation. Fifty
millions of American citizens anxiously awaiting Jumbo’s arrival. My
forty years invariable practice of exhibiting best that money could procure,
makes Jumbo’s presence here imperative. Hundred thousand pounds
would be no inducement to cancel the purchase....</p>

<p>In December next I visit Australia in person with Jumbo and my entire
mammoth combination of seven shows, <i>via</i> California, thence through
Suez Canal. Following summer to London. I shall then exhibit in
every prominent city in Great Britain. May afterwards return Jumbo
to his old position in Royal Zoölogical Gardens. Wishing long life and
prosperity to the British nation, “The Daily Telegraph,” and Jumbo, I
am the public’s obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right">P. T. BARNUM.</p>

</div>

<p>To this answer, the “Telegraph” referred in the following
editorial:—</p>

<p>“Jumbo’s fate is sealed. The disappointing answer from
his new American proprietor, which we published yesterday,
proves too clearly that there is nothing to expect from delicacy
or remorse in that quarter. Moved by the universal
emotion which the approaching departure of London’s gigantic
friend had aroused, we communicated with Mr. Barnum,
indicating that ‘money was no object’ if he would only
listen to the entreaties of the English children, and let the
Royal Zoölogical Council off their foolish bargain. The famous
showman replied—as all the world now knows—in
tones of polite but implacable decision. He has bought
Jumbo, and Jumbo he means to have; nor would ‘a hundred
thousand pounds’ be any inducement to cancel the purchase.
If innumerable childish hearts are grieving here over the
loss of a creature so gentle, vast, and sensible, ‘fifty millions
of American citizens,’ Mr. Barnum says, are anxiously waiting
to see the great elephant arrive in the States. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
to increase the general regret, the message depicts the sort
of life which poor Jumbo has before him. No more quiet
garden-strolls, no shady trees, green lawns, and flowery
thickets, peopled with tropical beasts, bright birds, and
snakes, making it all quite homely. Our amiable monster
must dwell in a tent, take part in the routine of a circus.
Mr. Barnum announces the intention of taking his ‘mammoth
combination of seven shows’ round the world, <i>via</i>
California, Australia, and the Suez Canal. Elephants hate
the sea. They love a quiet bath as much as any Christians;
but the indignity and terror of being slung on board a ship,
and tossed about in the agony of sea-sickness, which is probably
on a scale with the size of their stomachs, would appear
to them worse than death. Yet to this doom the children’s
‘dear old Jumbo’ is condemned; and it is enough, if he
knew of it, to precipitate that insanity which his guardians
have pretended to fear. It is true Mr. Barnum holds out
hopes that we may some day see again the colossal form of
the public favorite. In the summer of 1883 he proposes to
bring the good beast back to England, exhibiting him in
‘every prominent city;’ and the message adds, ‘I may afterwards
return Jumbo to his old position in the Royal Zoölogical
Gardens.’ There is a gleam of consolation in this, which
we would not darken by any remarks upon the great showman’s
ironclad inflexibility; but what will be the mental and
physical condition of our immense friend when bereavement,
sea-sickness, and American diet shall have ruined his temper
and digestion, and abolished his self-respect? There will be
a Yankee twang in his trumpeting; he will roll about on his
‘sea-legs,’ with a gait sadly changed from the substantial
swing so well known; and Alice herself will hardly know him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>“We fear, however, that Jumbo will never come back to
her and us alive. His mighty heart will probably break with
rage, shame, and grief; and we may hear of him, like another
Samson, playing the mischief with the Philistines who have
led him into captivity, and dying amid some scene of terrible
wrath and ruin. We hope Mr. Barnum fully realizes what
ten tons and a half of solid fury can do when it has a mind.”</p>

<p>The young folks, who were the greatest losers by the sale
of Jumbo, were not silent; and their attempts to move Mr.
Barnum are shown in the following letters:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">9 Dingle Hill, Liverpool</span>, March 7.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Barnum</span>,—Please do not take Jumbo to America, I
think it will be cruel if you do take him when he begs so hard not to be
taken. There are plenty of other elephants—will not one of them do
for you instead?—one that does not mind going. If you will only let
Jumbo stay, I am sure the English children will thank you; and I do not
think the people in America can be so cruel as to wish to have him when
it makes him so unhappy to leave England.</p>

<p class="right">GERTRUDE COX.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Turnbridge Wells, Kent.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">P. T. Barnum.</span></p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>,—You would receive the deepest and most grateful thanks
of the whole of the British nation, if you would only forego your bargain
about poor, dear Jumbo. You are so well known as the greatest showman
in the world, do be known now as the most generous-minded man.
I have always found American gentlemen to be every thing that was
good, kind, and chivalrous; and I hope you will show yourself a king
among them. We are all so attached to Jumbo, and he to his home, that
it would be really cruel to move him. He deserves to remain, I’m sure,
for his fidelity to all his surroundings, and his good temper under all his
present trials. I know the American mind is so large, that I have quite
expected each day to see in the papers that you would let Jumbo remain
in his old home. In fact, I have all along thought it one of your jokes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
Praying that you may change your mind, and that this letter may arrive
in time to assist to that end, I remain,</p>

<p class="right">ONE OF JUMBO’S SINCERE FRIENDS.</p>

<p>P. S.—I am sure you will never regret leaving Jumbo in peace.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Barnum</span>,—I write in behalf of our dear old Jumbo. Do be
kind and generous to our English boys and girls. We do so love him!
and I am sure if you have children or little friends of your own, you
will be able to understand how their hearts would ache, and their tears
be shed, should they lose the friend who has given them such delight, and
who is one of their few pleasures in this great and sorrowful city. We
all know from older and cleverer heads, that by rights Jumbo is yours, as
you have paid the money for him; but, dear Mr. Barnum, you who have
so many famous animals, and, among them, so many elephants, surely
will think seriously and kindly before you take from us our very dear
friend Jumbo. About the money for damages—I am sure all our parents
in this city, who love their little ones so much, will willingly help to give
you back your money, with an extra sum to make up for any expense you
may have had concerning him. Do let the kindest side of your nature
prevail. Think over the many hearts among us nearly breaking, and
ready to do any thing to implore you to give us back Jumbo. If only
you are generous to us in this, you will not lose by it, either in this world
or the next. I am nearly sure if Jumbo does go, he will die when he
reaches you, for he has clearly shown his great reluctance to leave us; and
the voyage, and every thing taken together, will have an ill effect on him;
that it will be but a poor Jumbo that will appear before you, even if a
worse thing does not happen, and the grief at leaving his old friends,
and such new experiences, does not turn him mad.</p>

<p>I think,—indeed I do not think, I am sure,—that if Jumbo had been
our purchase from you, and letters had been sent to us, telling of the sorrow
of American children at parting with an old favorite, every English
girl and boy, man and woman, would have said with one voice, that the
purchase-money should be given back, and the animal left to delight the
children across the Atlantic. I am sure the wish of possessing the finest
animal would not have crushed our manly and womanly feelings—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
those of all true men and women are generously in sympathy with the
cry of children in distress.</p>

<p>You say that perhaps Jumbo will return to us after you have exhibited
him. I am afraid he will not be alive to come, or, if he is, all his trust
in his old friends and keepers will be soured, and he will not seem like
the old friend he now is.</p>

<p>You may think it a waste of time for a young girl to write to you,
when older and wiser heads have failed; but I must tell you of the thousands
of children to whom the parting from Jumbo will be a terrible
grief. Be to us the generous-hearted man you are believed to be, and
give us back our Jumbo.</p>

<p class="center">I remain, yours truly,</p>

<p class="right">A YOUNG ENGLISH GIRL.</p>

<p>The ninety pupils of a school in the Edgeware road memorialized
the secretary of the London Zoo, who replied to
them thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Zoölogical Society of London, 11 Hanover Square, W.</span>, March 2, 1882.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friends</span>,—Your petition has been duly received, but I fear we
shall not be able to assent to your request. We must ask you to believe
that our experienced superintendent knows better what elephants are
suitable to be kept in the Society’s Gardens than you do. There are still
three elephants left in the gardens, upon which we hope you will have
many rides in future.</p>

<p class="center">Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">P. S. SCLATER, <i>Secretary to the Society</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>These appeals,—selected from the hundreds of such,—of
course, had no effect upon Mr. Barnum; and in the mean
time preparations had been going on to ship the giant. A
huge box was constructed, six feet eight inches in width, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
thirteen feet high, bound with heavy bands of three-fourths
inch iron, weighing in all six tons. Feb. 18, 1882, was selected
as the day for the start. To prevent any trouble, Jumbo
was heavily chained by his feet; and, after a struggle to break
his bonds, he was led toward the box that was to convey him
to the steamer. But elephants are naturally suspicious, and
Jumbo was no exception to the rule. Bracing back, he flatly
refused to enter; and the attempt was then given up. The
next day, another trial was made, with like success; then it
was proposed to walk the great animal to the steamer, with
the hope that, after the long tramp, he would enter the box
readily. Accordingly, the gates were thrown open, and
Jumbo marched out; and “then,” says “The London Telegraph,”
“came one of the most pathetic scenes in which a
dumb animal was ever the chief actor. The poor brute
moaned sadly, and appealed in all but human words to Scott,
his keeper, embracing the man with its trunk, and actually
kneeling before him.” In short, Jumbo refused to go, and
was again returned to his house; and then the storm of public
resentment broke out with renewed fury. The actions of
the elephant were contorted into every possible meaning: his
simplest acts and movements were given a significance which
in all probability they did not have, and the press urged that
some action be taken to prevent what was considered an outrage.
A prominent clergyman wrote, “I trust the people of
London will rise as one man, to prevent this cruel, inhuman
bargain being carried out. Are there not walls in England
strong enough to hold Jumbo, that we must send him
away?”</p>

<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_66"><i>Pages 66-70.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>Every legal obstacle was thrown in the way of the Americans.
The authorities objected to the elephant being led<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
through the streets; and, according to Mr. Barnum, the
superintendent of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals never left the Garden until Jumbo did, awaiting
an opportunity, according to the Americans, to use his authority
in favor of public sentiment. As a last resort, an interim
injunction was sworn out before Justice Chilly, restraining
the Council of the Zoölogical Society from allowing Jumbo
to be removed. But finally it was seen that Jumbo had
been purchased fairly; and in the last of March the great
elephant was coaxed into its box, and was ultimately hoisted
aboard the steamer “Assyrian Monarch,” and shipped to New
York, where he was hauled up Broadway in triumph by sixteen
horses and a large crowd who dragged upon ropes attached
to the wheeled box for the purpose; and from that
time to his death became the object of great attention.</p>

<p>One never tired looking at this stupendous animal. His
enormous size, the pillar-like legs,—columns of support
rather than for locomotion,—his stately movements, the pendulum-like
swinging of his huge trunk, all impressed the
observer that Jumbo was indeed the king among all animals,
and the most remarkable one ever seen upon this continent.</p>

<p>Jumbo continued with the Barnum circus until Sept. 13,
1885, when he met an untimely death in St. Thomas, Canada.
The final performance of the circus had been given; and
Jumbo and the trick elephant Tom were marching over the
track to reach their cars, guided by Scott, the former’s
trainer, when a heavy freight-train came rushing along from
the east. The headlight was not seen until the train was
within five hundred yards of the animals, and was not expected,
as the railroad officials had assured the men that a
train was not due for an hour. Signals were given as soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
as possible, and the brakes were put on; while the elephants
fled up the track, led by Scott, who stood by them to the
last: but the heavy train could not be stopped, being on a
down grade; and with a thundering roar it came on, striking
the clown elephant, and hurling him into a ditch, then crashing
into the ponderous Jumbo, the contact stopping the train,
and derailing the engine and two cars.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Jumbo was struck in the hind-legs; and
it is said, as he felt the cow-catcher, he gave a loud roar,
turned and fell; the first car passing along his back, and
inflicting wounds from which he died in fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Jumbo’s measurements after death were found to be as
follows: circumference of the fore-arm, five feet six inches;
height, about eleven feet two inches; length of trunk, seven
feet four inches; around the tusk, one foot three and a half
inches; length of fore-leg, six feet. Mr. Barnum presented
the skeleton to the National Museum, and the skin to Tufts
College, of Massachusetts, where they will ultimately go.
The two gifts were mounted by Professor Ward of Rochester,
probably the most stupendous piece of taxidermy ever
attempted in any country; and, as such, it may be of interest
to know something of the methods employed. Professor
Ward thus describes his work in a letter to Mr. Barnum:
... “Fortunately, we had one good life-photograph, also
many measurements of his body, taken after the sad accident
in Canada. The mounting was a matter involving
such formidable conditions of weight and size, that no ordinary
base would serve to support him. His pedestal was
first built of heavy oak beams, the crossbars on which he
stands being six by nine inches in thickness. In these were
planted eight great standards of two-inch iron,—two of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
them to go through each leg,—which were bolted above into
equally heavy cross-beams, which held them together, and
strengthened the whole. Other beams ran lengthwise of the
body, placed straight, obliquely, diagonally, and in every
direction calculated to strengthen and stiffen, and all bound
together with rods and bars and bolts. One great beam,
reaching from rear part through the body to centre of his
forehead, is calculated to sustain fully a ton’s weight, if at
any time his great head should need such support. The
outlines of his body and legs are then obtained by properly
fastening pieces of thick plank on edge, and cutting them to
form required. The further final contour of the body is
secured by covering these timbers with wooden coating two
inches thick, and all built up, cut and chiselled to the exact
form desired in every part. Thus was gradually built up
an elephant of almost solid wood, of Jumbo’s exact size and
form. To this was applied his vast skin, weighing over
three-quarters of a ton, and the same nailed and screwed in
place over the entire surface and along the seams. There
was no intermediate filling, and his skin now fits his wooden
body in every part as closely as does the bark on a tree.”</p>

<p>In mounting the skeleton, Professor Ward made some
interesting observations, and was able to compare Jumbo’s
frame with that of a full-grown mastodon which was being
mounted at the same time. That Jumbo was quite a young
animal, was determined from an examination of his teeth and
bones; and, gigantic as he was, he might have attained much
larger dimensions.</p>

<p>To take Jumbo’s place, Mr. Barnum has purchased Alice,
the large African elephant of the London Zoölogical Garden,
who, according to Tegetmier, “is not of an amiable temper.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
Alice is an African elephant, perfect with the exception of
the tip end of her trunk, which was torn off some years ago.
She is about the age of the late Jumbo, and will also find a
resting-place, when her term has run, in some of the American
institutions of science.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW ASIATIC ELEPHANTS ARE CAPTURED ALIVE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Though the tusks of the Asiatic elephant are not large
and valuable enough to make its capture for that purpose
profitable, the live animal itself is greatly esteemed as a
beast of burden, and as a show-animal in the pageants of the
native princes, every petty court or rich man considering it
necessary to his dignity to possess a number of the huge animals.
To supply this demand, professional hunters are in
the field during every season, using several different methods
to entrap the great game. If the plan is to capture a large
number of elephants at a time, kheddahs, or enclosures, are
built; this method being the one now in use by the Government
Hunting-Establishment in Bengal. To make it successful,
about four hundred natives are required; and their duties
are so different and varied, that a page from the pay-roll, and
list of duties from the books of Mr. G. P. Sanderson, officer
in charge of the Government Elephant-Catching Establishment
in Mysore, are appended:—</p>

<p>These men constitute a well-organized army of elephant-hunters
under the immediate command of a jemadar, or native
sergeant, who in turn is responsible to a British or European
officer. Besides the remuneration in the above pay-roll, each
man receives free rations equal to two pounds of rice a day,
two pounds of salt fish, chillies, salt, etc., per month. The
total expense of a party is about twelve hundred dollars.
Besides these numerous hunters, every party has a number
of tame elephants, or koonkies, upon which the success of the
hunt often depends. It is estimated that one tame elephant
can manage two wild ones. This consists in leading the captives
to water, bringing them fodder, etc. The Asiatic hunting-parties
generally organize in December, and enter the
field for two or three months. When the advance-guard discovers
a herd, the large party comes to a stand-still some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
distance away, and then begins an organized system of progression.
The men divide, and spread out in a circle, the
object being to surround the herd; and, when complete,
the natives often cover six or eight miles of ground, the men
being some distance apart. When the word has been passed
that the herd is in the centre, a bamboo fence is quickly put
up, the material being at hand: in two or three hours, perhaps,
the animals are entirely surrounded, and the men on
the alert to see that they do not break out. During the day
the elephants are generally not visible; and at night bonfires
are built around the great circle, and the men by yells and
shouts keep the terrified animals in the centre. Here they
are watched, perhaps for a week, the men remaining at the
posts, where they erect rude huts, and make themselves comfortable.
As soon as the bamboo enclosure is completed, the
important work, or the kheddah, is commenced,—a fence
within the large one. To construct this, half the guard are
detailed; and in a remarkably short time a stout fence is built
in a circular form, about twelve feet in height, and from sixty
to one hundred and fifty feet in diameter, braced and supported
in the strongest manner; while all around the inside of the
fence a ditch four feet wide is made. An opening about
twelve feet wide is left on one side, facing one of the elephant
runs, or tracts. To guide the elephants to the gate,
palisades are built, diverging from it to a distance of one hundred
and fifty feet. This arranged, the men close in on the
herd, and, by shouting and firing, force them along the drive
that leads to the funnel-shaped opening. Into this they run
in a terrified throng; and, when all are in, the gate, which is
a heavy affair studded with nails, is lowered by men stationed
overhead, and a shout of triumph rises from the crowd of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
coolies. The elephants are now completely at their mercy.
The fence is strong enough to prevent an outbreak; and, even
if it were not, the ditch prevents their approaching it near
enough to test their strength. Sometimes an elephant more
plucky than the rest will make the attempt, and go through
it like paper: but the elephant lacks intelligence in some
things; and, when a break has been made by one, the others
rarely follow the leader, a few shouting coolies being sufficient
to keep them back.</p>

<p>The elephants do not always enter the kheddah so willingly,
but break away, running over the men, and often killing
numbers of them; but, as a rule, a well drilled and
organized party manages the drive without great difficulty.
When the herd is under control, the tame elephants are
marched in, each with its mahout, or driver, upon its neck;
and it is a curious fact, again showing the elephant’s lack of
intelligence, that the men are never touched, though they
could be hauled from the tame animals with the greatest ease.
Acting under the directions of the mahouts, the tame elephants
separate the wild ones one by one from the herd; and,
when they are surrounded, the men, or tiers, slip to the
ground, and pass ropes or chains about their hind-legs, by
which they are picketed until they have been reduced to
subjection.</p>

<p>For many years elephants have been caught in Bengal,
and the above plan for taking entire herds at a time is now
in use by Mr. Sanderson.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> His most successful operations
were carried on near the village of Chámraj-Nuggar near the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
foot of the Billiga-rungun hills. His first plan was met by
much ridicule from the natives; and all the true Mussulmans
were firm in the belief that no good would come of it, for the
very good reason that there was a curse handed down by a
former unsuccessful elephant-trapper for the benefit of any
one who made the attempt to capture an entire herd after
him. The natives were willing, however, to enter the employ
of the official for a consideration, probably when they
were convinced that the curse would fall upon him alone.
Be this as it may, he had no difficulty in organizing a good
band of elephant-hunters; and in a short time a plan of operations
was formed on the Houhollay River. The first
attempt was unsuccessful, but the next season an entire herd
was captured; and since then, many large herds have been
secured, the business being a valuable one to the government.
The following is a description of one of these government
hunts from the pen of Mr. Sanderson, the officer in charge:—</p>

<p>“It was past mid-day before we got all the elephants into
cover, and not a minute’s rest did any of us get until eleven
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Capt. C⸺, of the revenue survey, came over from his
camp at Surgoor, and Major G⸺, and he helped to superintend
the people. At one point, the supply of tools was insufficient;
and Capt. C⸺ was superintending and encouraging
a body of men who were digging with sharpened sticks,
and even their bare fingers. The elephants were very noisy
in the cover, but did not show themselves. At every twenty
yards three or four men were stationed to keep up large fires.
These were reflected in the water of the channel and river,
which increased their effect. We all had a most exaggerated
idea of what the elephants might attempt; and the strength
of our defences was in proportion, and greater than they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
need have been. I was kept on the move almost all night by
false alarms at different points, fortunately groundless ones.
One tusker showed himself on the bank of the channel, but
met with such a reception from firebrands and stones, that
he retreated in haste. The river was an advantage, as the
elephants had easy access to water. The lurid glare of the
fires, the giant figures of the lightly clad watchers, their wild
gesticulations on the bank with waving torches, the background
of dense jungle resonant with trumpeting of the
giants of the forest, formed a scene which words are feeble to
depict, and that cannot fade from the memories of those who
witnessed it. By eleven <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the defences were thoroughly
secured; and that the elephants could not now escape, was
certain, unless, indeed, they carried some of our barricades,
which were, however, so strong as to be almost beyond their
power. The men differed as to their number. I had seen
about twenty: some declared there were fifty, but I could
not believe this at the time. The number was fifty-four, as
we subsequently found. The excitement of the scene was
irresistible; so I betook myself to walking around the enclosure
at intervals throughout the night, followed by a man
carrying a basket of cheroots, which I distributed to the
people. The rest of the time I lay upon my cot, which my
servant had been thoughtful enough to bring from Morlay,
enjoying the wildness of the sounds and scenes around, and
soothed by cheroots and coffee. When the elephants approached
the place where I was, the guards thrust long bamboos
into the fires, which sent showers of sparks up to the
tops of the trees overhead, where they exploded with a sound
like pistol-shots. The first crow of the jungle-cock was the
most grateful sound I think I ever heard, as it showed our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
anxious vigil was drawing to a close. We knew that during
the day the elephants would give us no trouble. My herdsmen
now joined me from the points where they had been stationed
during the night, and we set about considering the
next step to be taken; namely, making a small enclosure, or
pound, into which to get the elephants confined. Of course,
this would take some time to carry out. If driven from the
east, we knew that the animals would pass between the temple
and channel at the west end of the cover, with a view to
crossing the river below the temple, and regaining their
native hills, which, however, they were fated never to see
again. I therefore laid out a pound of one hundred yards in
diameter, surrounded by a ditch nine feet wide at top, three
at bottom, and nine feet deep. This was connected with the
larger cover by two guiding trenches which converged to
the gate. It was completed in four days by the personal
exertions of the amildár with a body of laborers who worked
with a will, as their crops had suffered from the incursions of
elephants, and they appreciated the idea of reducing their
numbers.</p>

<p>“The last thing completed was the entrance gate, which
consisted of three transverse trunks of trees slung by chains
between two trees that formed gate-posts. This barrier was
hauled up and suspended by a single rope, so as to be cut
away after the elephants passed. The news of the intended
drive attracted several visitors from Mysore. Tents were
pitched in an open glade close to the river, and we soon had
a pleasant party of ladies and gentlemen. The evening
before the drive, all assembled within view of the point where
the elephants were in the habit of drinking at sunset, and
were gratified with an admirable view of the huge creatures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
disporting themselves timidly in the water. On the morning
of the 17th, every thing being in readiness for the drive,
Capts. P., B., and I proceeded with some picked hands to
drive the herd from its stronghold towards the pound. We
succeeded in moving them through the thick parts of the
cover with rockets, and soon got them near to its entrance.
A screened platform had been erected for the ladies at a
point near the gate, where they could see the final drive into
the enclosure from a place of safety. The elephants, however,
when near the entrance, made a stand, and refused to
proceed, and finally, headed by a determined female, turned
upon the beaters, and threatened to break down an open
glade. P. and I intercepted them, and most of them hesitated;
but the leading female, the mother of an albino calf,
which had been evilly disposed from the beginning, rushed
down upon me, as I happened to be directly in her path, with
shrill screams, followed by four or five others, which, however,
advanced less boldly. When within five yards, I floored
her with my eight-bore Greener and ten drams; but, though
the heavy ball hit the right spot between the eyes, the shot
was not fatal; as the head was carried in a peculiar position,
and the bullet passed under the brain. The elephant fell at
the shot, almost upon me, and P. fired; and I gave her my
second barrel, which in the smoke missed her head, but took
effect in her chest, and must have penetrated to the region of
the heart, as a heavy jet of blood spouted forth when she
rose. For a moment she swayed about, then fell to rise no
more. This was a painful sight. The elephant had only
acted in defence of her young; but shooting her was unavoidable,
as our lives, as well as those of the beaters, were in
jeopardy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“The next scene partook of the ridiculous. The herd dispersed,
and regained its position. The little albino calf, seeing
P., screamed wildly, and with ears extended, and tail
aloft, chased him. He, wishing to save it, darted around the
trees, but was near coming to grief, as he tripped and fell.
The result might have been disastrous had I not given the
pertinacious youngster a telling butt in the head with my
eight-bore. His attention was next turned to a native, who
took to his heels when he found that three sharp blows with
a club on the head had little effect. After some severe
struggles, in which a few natives were floored, the calf was
at last secured to a tree by a native’s waist-cloth and a jungle-creeper.</p>

<p>“While all this took place, the beat became thoroughly disorganized.
When the elephant had charged P. and me, our
men had given way; and the herd regained its original position,
at the extreme east end of the cover. After a short
delay, we beat it up again to the spot near the gate from
which it had broken back. The elephants had formed a
dense mob, and began moving round and round in a circle,
hesitating to cross the newly filled-in trench, which had
reached from the channel to the river, but which was now
refilled to allow them to pass on into the kheddah. At
length they were forced to proceed by the shots fired, and
by the firebrands carried through the paths in the thicket.
The bright eyes of the fair watchers near the gate were at
length gratified by seeing one great elephant after another
pass the Rubicon. After a short pause, owing to a stand
being made by some of the most refractory, the last of the
herd passed in with a rush, closely followed into the inner
enclosure by a frantic beater, waving a firebrand. P. and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
I came up third, in time to save any accident from the fall
of the barrier. C., who was perched on a light branch of
the gate-post, cut the rope; and, amidst the cheers of all,
the valuable prize of fifty-three elephants was secured to the
Mysore Government. I often think of the rapture of that
moment. How warmly we sahibs shook hands! How my
trackers hugged my legs, and prostrated themselves before
P. and B.! An hour of such varied excitement as elephant-catching
is surely worth a lifetime of uneventful routine in
town.”</p>

<p>Such is the account of an enthusiastic hunter, one of the
best living authorities on these elephants; and few men have
enjoyed his privileges. To complete the capture of this herd,
seventeen tame elephants were employed; and finally they
were all tamed and ready for use. They consisted of sixteen
male elephants, the largest being eight feet five inches at the
shoulder; three mucknas, or tuskless males; thirty females,
and nine young ones. Nine were given to the Mahárájah’s
stud, ten to the Madras Commissariat Department, while
twenty-five were sold at public auction when they were tame
enough to be used by purchasers. The latter realized about
$415 apiece, or in a bulk $10,425; and the amount realized
from the entire catch, deducting the deaths, was $18,770.
Deducting from this the total sum of expenditures from Mr.
Sanderson’s first attempt at their capture in 1873, or $7,780,
a profit to the government remained of $10,995. Mr.
Sanderson was congratulated by the chief commissioner of
Mysore, and his excellency the viceroy and governor-general
in council, and has since continued to capture elephants on
this plan, always with marked success. His last catch that
I have record of, that of 1882, was two hundred and fifty-one,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
and that only up to March. The first drive yielded sixty-five,
and the second fifty-five, elephants. These animals were
taken in the Garrow Hills.</p>

<p>A second method of taking wild elephants in India is by
following them with females trained for the purpose. This
plan is usually more successful in the capture of large tuskers
than the kheddah, as the latter are often away from the herd,
and do not become entrapped. The hunt is generally composed
of four or five well-trained female elephants ridden by
mahouts, who sit upon their necks, and are hidden by cloths
or blankets of the same color as the elephant’s skin. In
some works, these elephants are called decoys; but this is an
entirely mistaken idea. The tame elephants use no arts to
attract the wild ones, in the sense of a decoy, merely obeying
the commands or signs of the keeper.</p>

<p>When the location of a single male is determined, the
tame elephants approach the spot in a leisurely manner, feeding
as they move. Sometimes the wild elephant scents the
mahouts, and moves off; but, as often, they do not seem to
notice them; and, if not, the tame ones gradually surround
him, and endeavor by command of their mahouts, who direct
them by signs, to keep its attention. Generally there is an
elephant in the near vicinity, loaded with ropes and other
material; and, as several days are occupied, the men are
relieved every day, the elephants drawing off one by one,
and returning with fresh men.</p>

<p>This surveillance is kept up day and night; and, during
the latter, the wild elephant goes into the fields to feed, being
closely followed by the seemingly treacherous females with
their concealed drivers. When he returns to the forest as
the day approaches, they follow: and as he lies down, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
tries to go to sleep, they close in about him, and, at the command
of the mahouts, keep him awake by various devices;
all this performance resulting in thoroughly fatiguing the old
fellow, and making him sleep very soundly when he does
take a nap. Sometimes an elephant is fed with sugar-cane
loaded with opium, to make him sleep; and, as soon as he
has fallen into a deep slumber, the mahouts slip off behind,
and securely tie his legs. Then the men in the rear come
up, and rudely awaken him, slapping him on his haunches,
and telling him facetiously to be of “good cheer.”</p>

<p>The struggles of the trapped elephant are terrific, and
they often injure themselves fatally. The tame elephants
follow them up until they are thoroughly subdued, when
they are securely bound, and led to the place where their
training commences; and a few months later, they are carrying
their human owners about, or working in the timber
district, as if they had not been wild elephants so short a
time before.</p>

<p>A third method of taking elephants here is by the pitfall,—a
barbarous custom, not now in general practice, as it
always resulted in the loss by death of a large proportion of
the catch. The plan was to dig pitfalls in the well-known
and beaten tracts of elephants in the jungle, or under certain
trees where they were known to congregate to feed. These
traps, or holes, were generally ten and a half feet long by
seven and a half broad, and fifteen feet deep, being purposely
small, so that the imprisoned animals could not dig down
the earth with their tusks, which they often did. In former
years, there was, according to the government official, a perfect
network of these pits in Mysore, and kept in order by the
Mahárájah, the Forest Department, and others. The natives,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
as the Strolagas and Kurrabas, also made pits; and when an
elephant was trapped, and they had no way of getting it out,
the poor creatures often died before a tame elephant could
be secured to give the required assistance. Through the endeavors
of Sanderson, this inhuman practice has been given
up; and all elephants caught are treated as humanely as
possible.</p>

<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_77"><i>Page 77.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>A fourth plan of capture is by noosing wild elephants
from the back of a tame one; and this affords a most excellent
and manly sport, to be commended, as the animal is
given fair play, and boldly met in the field. It is confined
to Bengal and Napaul, not being practised in Southern India,
and is not in favor for the reason that not rarely the tame
elephants are badly injured, and the wear and tear upon them
is too great. The sport is extremely dangerous, and is carried
on something after the fashion of lariating wild cattle
in the West of our own country. Fast elephants are selected,
and three drivers provided each. One sits on the neck, to
direct it; another sits near the tail, and, with a spike and a
mallet, is supposed to hammer the unfortunate animal as
hard as possible, just over the spot marked by the <i>os coccygis</i>.
This is to spur the elephant on to excessive bursts of speed,
and generally success. A third man sits on a pad upon the
elephant’s back, and holds a noose, the other end of the rope
being strapped about the animal’s body.</p>

<p>Thus fitted, a wild herd is followed; and, once sighted, the
last man hammers at the creature with his spike and mallet,
and away they go, over the rocks and through the bush in a
wild chase. If the tame elephants are fleet enough, they
soon range alongside, and give the rope-handler an opportunity
to test his skill, which he does by throwing the noose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
over the head of the nearest elephant. Some natives are very
expert at this; but men are often hauled off and crushed, or
the elephants are choked, and many accidents occur.</p>

<p>A different kind of noosing is practised in Ceylon, where
men follow the animals on foot, and throw a noose so skilfully,
that they catch them about their legs when running at
full speed through the jungle. As soon as this is accomplished,
the men follow along, and twist the end about a tree,
and soon have the great game at their mercy.</p>

<p>In all these cases, there is great danger, but not so much as
where the animal is followed by the hunter on foot, and meets
the huge creature face to face, his object being the tusks;
described in a separate chapter on elephant-hunting as a
sport.</p>

<span class="smaller">ASIATIC ELEPHANTS IN CAPTIVITY.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In the previous chapter we have seen how elephants were
captured in the early times in India, and how modern
methods have humanized the entire system of their seizure;
and now we will glance at the huge captives in confinement.
The Asiatic elephant is a marketable commodity, and is
bought and sold like the horse in this country. After the
government has selected those needed for its use, the rest
are sold. Certain places have become famous for their sales.
Stōnepoor, on the Ganges, is, perhaps, the best known; and
here, every year, a great fair is held, and many elephants sold
and exchanged. This location is particularly favorable for
the purpose, as hundreds of thousands of pilgrims meet here
to worship at the famous shrine of Shiva.</p>

<p>The scene at this time is one of great activity: and immense
numbers of elephants are exhibited, and many sharp
bargains made; as the East Indian elephant-traders are not a
whit behind the horse-dealers of Western countries.</p>

<p>Another celebrated elephant headquarters in Bengal, where
these animals are sometimes sold, is at Dacca, a populous
native city of seventy thousand inhabitants. It is about one
hundred miles from the sea, and was once noted as a ship-building
port, and headquarters for a fleet of eight hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
armed vessels, whose duty it was to protect the southern
coast from the cruel Arracanese pirates. From its location
on a branch of the Ganges, it is admirably adapted as the
headquarters of the Bengal Elephant-catching Establishment,
water, grasses, and fodder of various kinds, being plentiful;
while its availability to the forests of Sylhet Cachár and
Chittagong, which abound in wild elephants, render it a comparatively
easy matter for the captives to be brought to a
first-class market.</p>

<p>The elephant depot is called a peelkhána, and stands in
the suburbs of the town. It embraces an area about a quarter
of a mile square, consisting of an intrenched quadrangular
piece of ground, where the pickets, to which the
elephants are tethered, are arranged in regular rows. Each
picket is provided with a solid floor of stone or mortar,
where there is a post to which the elephants are fastened.
During the heat of the day, they are removed to sheds. In
the enclosures are numbers of buildings, containing the gear,
and various appliances used about elephants. There is a
hospital, where the invalid elephants are tended; for, if elephants
do not die very often, they sometimes get sick, and
are then given the best of treatment. There is also a hospital,
or room, for the native doctor, who doses the elephants’
attendants when they require it, as only a native doctor can
do; and, as the elephants have a European to look after them
when ill, they probably have the best of it. This great depot
is under an English officer, who generally organizes the great
hunts that have been described. The establishment is composed
at all times of about fifty trained elephants, called
koonkies. Besides these, there are always a number undergoing
the training process; and, when ready for service, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
are divided up among the various military stations, or sold,
as the case may be. Stōnepoor is the scene of great public
sales. Here those who wish to make a selection from many
elephants, congregate; and their ideas of good points are
strangely at variance with our own. The natives recognize
three different castes, or breeds, based upon certain physical
peculiarities; and, when about to purchase, they state which
class they wish to invest in. In Bengal, these breeds are
known as <i>Koomeriah</i>, <i>Dwásala</i>, and <i>Meerga</i>; meaning, first,
second, and third class animals. The word <i>Koomeriah</i> implies
royalty, and is supposed to possess every excellence, and
is among elephants what Maud S. or St. Julian are among
trotting-horses. Its points, according to Sanderson, are: barrel
deep, and of great girth; legs short (especially the hind
ones) and colossal, the front pair convex on the front side
from the development of the muscles; back straight and flat,
but sloping from shoulder to tail, as an up-standing elephant
must be high in front; head and chest massive, neck thick
and short; trunk broad at the base, and proportionately heavy
throughout; bump between the eyes prominent; cheeks full;
the eye full, bright, and kindly; hindquarters square and
plump, the skin rumpled, thick, inclining to folds at the root
of the tail, and soft. If the face, base of trunk, and ears be
blotched with cream-colored markings,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the animal’s value is
enhanced thereby. The tail must be long, but not touch the
ground, and be well feathered. A <i>Koomeriah</i> should be
about nine feet and over high.</p>

<p>The temper of these animals of both sexes is, as a rule,
superior to that of others; and, according to the above
authority, while gentleness and submissiveness are characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
of all elephants, the <i>Koomeriah</i> possesses these qualities,
and unanimity, urbanity, and courage, in a high degree. In
short, the <i>Koomeriah</i> is the standard of perfection among
elephants.</p>

<p>The <i>Dwásala</i> caste includes all those which rank just below
this in point of excellence; while the <i>Meerga</i>, which is supposed
to be a corruption of the Sanscrit <i>Mriga</i>, a deer, refers
to all the rest; almost the reverse of the first caste in every
particular, being long and thin of limb, with an arched,
sharp-ridged back, a thin, flabby trunk, and long and lean
neck; the head small, and eyes piggish. In fact, its whole
appearance is often indicative of its nature; that is, mean and
cowardly at times. The <i>Meerga</i>, however, is not without a
value, being the swifter of the race; and, if speed alone is
required, it is more valued than the <i>Koomeriah</i>. They can
always be obtained, while <i>Koomeriahs</i> are not always in the
market. The Kábul merchants make a specialty of them, as
our Kentucky dealers do of blooded horse-stock. Many are
attached to the various courts, and devote their entire time
in hunting for first-class animals for their masters.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that an elephant dies after almost
reaching the city, and the merchant is nearly ruined; but in
such cases an Eastern nobleman would consider it beneath
his dignity to refuse to pay for the defunct animal;—an
example of true Oriental munificence.</p>

<p>The price of elephants has increased in India of late years,
though their numbers are not growing less. In 1835 they
could be bought for $225 apiece; in 1855 for $375; in 1874,
$660. Now $750 is the lowest figure for which even a young
animal can be purchased. Though the prices are very
capricious, good females of full growth bring from $1,000 to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
$1,500; and $10,000 is often paid for a fine <i>Koomeriah</i>.
These are all bought up by rájahs and others, who use them
in their retinues, and for temple purposes.</p>

<p>Elephants were often in the olden times grossly treated
and starved; but in the present day they are too valuable to
be neglected, and are, as a rule, carefully tended when under
the observation of Europeans; but, if left to the mercies of
the natives to-day, they will often deprive them of food if
any thing can be gained by it.</p>

<p>The captive elephants require much care, from the enormous
amount of food they eat. In Bengal and Madras, the
government decides how much each elephant shall have for
breakfast, dinner, and supper; and the allowance is a liberal
one. In Bengal the rations per day are four hundred pounds
of green fodder, which means grass, sugar-cane, or branches
of trees; or two hundred and forty pounds of dry fodder,
namely, stalks of cut grain. In Madras, only two hundred
and fifty pounds of green fodder, and one hundred and
twenty-five of dry, are allowed;—not by any means the
amount a full-grown, hearty elephant will eat. A large
tusker requires eight hundred pounds of green fodder
every eighteen hours, or day. In eight females which were
watched by Mr. Sanderson, commencing at six <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, they
ate an average weight of six hundred and fifty pounds by
twelve <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the next day. They also had eighteen pounds
of grain a day.</p>

<p>The elephants are required to bring in their own green
fodder; and one can conveniently carry a load of eight
hundred pounds, or one day’s food.</p>

<p>The discrepancy between this showing and that which the
Madras elephants received, was made a subject of investigation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
by the government at the suggestion of Mr. Sanderson,
and resulted in the poor creatures receiving their proper
allowance. It was found by the investigating officers, that
the animals which had been having two hundred and fifty
pounds of green fodder, could eat seven hundred and fifty
pounds of dry sugar-cane: so for years they had been
worked hard and half starved, merely because the government
had fixed the rate <i>per diem</i>. This is another instance
of the reforms that have been instituted by Mr. Sanderson,
who has the thanks of all admirers of this noble animal.</p>

<p>If an elephant in confinement possesses such a seemingly
enormous appetite, a herd must be an expensive luxury to
keep. In Bengal the expense for one elephant <i>per mensem</i>
is as follows:—</p>

<span class="smaller">HUNTING THE ASIATIC ELEPHANT.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The lion and tiger share the time-honored term of king
of beasts; their courage, intrepid natures, majestic
bearing, and record for ferocity, having earned them the
title, in the estimation of many. But, when compared to
the elephant, these noble animals are mere pretenders. The
elephant is the true king, the monarch of the land in size
and strength, and capable, when thoroughly enraged, of toying
with the tiger or lion. Rarely does an elephant fall a
victim to either of these animals, and then only in their
extreme youth. An instance is recorded by Sanderson which
was considered so remarkable that he made a long trip to
the place to verify it.</p>

<p>The elephant was a mere baby,—a calf four and a half
feet at the shoulder, and weighing, perhaps, six hundred
pounds. It had wandered off into the jungle, where it was
pounced upon by the man-eater; falling an easy victim, as
its legs were tied to each other. The tiger had sprung upon
it, seizing it by the throat as it would a bullock, and dragged
it twenty or thirty feet, there feasting upon its quarters.</p>

<p>Another instance is recorded of a hobbled, or tied, elephant
being attacked by a man-eater; but the animal’s cries
attracted the attention of the keeper, and it was saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>An animal so powerful as the elephant would naturally
afford the grandest sport to the hunter; and, in following the
great game, more dangers are incurred, and risks run, than
in any known chase.</p>

<p>We have seen, that, in trapping elephants, every attempt
is made to preserve them from injury: but, in hunting
them for mere sport, this is reversed; and the animal is followed,
either on foot or horseback, and shot as quickly as
possible. This is often a most dangerous operation, and
accompanied by the death of hunter and attendants. In
trapping elephants, the men have the fences to retreat to,
and tame elephants to hide behind; but the true sportsman
follows the game into its own haunts, the deepest jungle, and
boldly faces it, giving the noble creature an even chance for
its life.</p>

<p>Sir Samuel Baker and Sanderson both say that elephant-shooting
is the most dangerous of all sports if fairly followed
for a length of time. Many elephants may be killed without
the sportsman being in any peril; but, if an infuriated
beast does make an attack, its charge is one of supreme danger.
The risk has this charm, that, though so great unless
steadily and skilfully met, it is within the sportsman’s power,
by coolness and good shooting, to end it and the assailant’s
career by one well-planted ball.</p>

<p>The wild elephant’s attack is one of the noblest sights of
the chase, and a grander animated object than a wild elephant
in full charge can hardly be imagined. The cocked ears and
broad forehead present an immense frontage. The head is
held high, with the trunk coiled between the tusks, to be uncoiled
in the moment of attack. The massive fore-legs come
down with the force and regularity of ponderous machinery;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
and the whole figure is rapidly foreshortened, and appears
to double in size with each advancing stride. The trunk
being doubled, and unable to emit any sound, the attack is
made in silence, and after the usual premonitory shriek,
which adds to its impressiveness. (See Plate XXIII.)
[Transcriber’s Note: There is no Plate XXIII. Possibly
<a href="#plate16">Plate XVI.</a> is meant, from the description
in this paragraph.]</p>

<p>In former times the natives hunted the elephant with what
are called <i>jinjalls</i>,—nothing more nor less than small cannon
weighing about forty-five pounds, and mounted on a tripod-stand
or carriage. The bullet used was of lead, weight about
half a pound, and propelled by half a pound of native powder.
Each hunting-party was fitted out with one of these, which
was borne on a pole by four men,—two men carrying the
gun itself, one the stand, while the fourth was the captain,
who did the aiming and firing.</p>

<p>When the game was discovered by these pot-hunters, the
gun was placed about three feet from the ground, aimed
at any portion of the body, and fired. A fuze was generally
used; and, igniting this, the valiant sportsmen ran away as
fast as possible,—indeed, for their lives, as the cannon usually
kicked completely over: and often limbs were broken,
and other accidents occurred, the result of tardiness in
retreating.</p>

<p>These guns were usually fatal at ninety or one hundred
feet; and the unfortunate brutes rarely escaped if hit, often
being desperately wounded. As many as five or six have
been taken in this way, during the time that the Madras
Government offered thirty dollars a head for them, to reduce
their numbers; and elephant-hunting became a lucrative
business, adopted by every one who could buy a jinjall.</p>

<p>The weapons now used in elephant-hunting are rifles; and
the heaviest bore that can be carried with convenience is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
generally none too large, though Sir Samuel Baker usually
used a light gun; this being, however, because he could not
shoot with a heavy one.</p>

<p>The larger the gun, the less opportunity there is of game
escaping, to die a lingering death; and this generally decides
the true sportsman. During the last decade, twelve-bore rifles
were greatly used (1½ oz. ball), but these are rarely seen now.
Sanderson, one of the best living authorities on the subject
of hunting the Asiatic elephant, killed several of his first
elephants with a No. 12 spherical-ball rifle with hard bullets
and six drachms of powder. But this he discarded for a
No. 4 double smooth bore, C. F., weighing nineteen and
a half pounds, built by W. W. Greener. With this he fires
twelve drachms of powder. Another gun, a No. 8 double
rifle, firing twelve drachms, and weighing seventeen pounds,
same make, he recommends, having stopped several charging
elephants with it. No game in America requires such
heavy arms, but the huge elephant demands weapons in proportion
to its size.</p>

<p>In the majority of animals, a shot in any vital part is
sufficient to disable them to some extent: but, in Asiatic-elephant
shooting, there are only three shots that can be
depended upon; and the sportsman must be somewhat well
acquainted with the anatomy of the animal to successfully
make them. The three vulnerable spots are the front, the
bullet striking the forehead; the side, or temple; and the
rear, or behind the ear. The brain of the animal is the mark;
and it is so small in proportion to the rest of the skull, that
a slight change of position, either raising or depressing the
head, will render the shot futile. This can be seen by examining
a section of an elephant’s skull. (<a href="#plate1">See Plate I.</a>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>The elephant sportsman usually makes elaborate preparations
for the sport, taking a sufficient number of
natives, servants, and trackers, with provisions to stay in
the field some time; and only after some practice can he
approach a herd, and pick out his shot, with any feeling
of confidence.</p>

<p>The true hunter disregards the females, seeking the old
tuskers; and to approach a herd without giving the alarm
requires great caution, and not a little experience. The great
game is generally found moving gradually in a given direction,
feeding as they go. If they are approached from the
wind, they scent danger from afar: but the experienced hunter
creeps up against the wind, and ordinary caution enables him
to approach within thirty or forty feet,—quite near enough,
my readers would think, when one knows, that, upon the first
shot, the entire herd will charge madly in any and every
direction. The old tuskers, the heads of the family, rarely
cover the retreat of a herd when an attack is made, usually
starting off on their own account, leaving the others to look
out for themselves.</p>

<p>When the presence of the hunter is realized, the one who
makes the discovery informs the rest by a “peculiar short,
shrill trumpet,” understood by old hunters as well. The
herd immediately cease feeding, all standing perfectly still,
probably using their ears and scent, or perhaps making up
their minds which way to go. The next movement differs
in different cases. Sometimes the herd charge wildly in any
direction; sometimes in a body; or, again, they move with
such remarkable celerity and silence, that even old hunters
have been deceived.</p>

<p>This peculiarity of the elephant, the largest of living land<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
animals, is extremely remarkable. How such a huge body
can make its way through bamboo and jungle so gently, is
hard to imagine; but often, after the first rapid rush, there is
absolute silence; and the novice comes to a stand-still, thinking
that the game has followed suit. On the contrary, the
headlong charge of the herd has been changed to a rapid
walk, so silent, that persons in very close proximity to a band
making off in this way, have failed to hear even the boughs
and bushes scraping against the thick hide.</p>

<p>A charging herd will soon overtake a man, especially if
he runs up-hill; and the appearance of a mass of bobbing
heads and elevated ears moving forward through the jungle,
is quite sufficient to unnerve the majority of men. When a
charge is made, the natives rush for trees or clumps of bamboos,
or often escape by standing still, so small an object
being passed by in the fury of the rush.</p>

<p>Exactly what a herd will do when attacked, it is impossible
to say. If they have never heard a shot before, they often
huddle together in the greatest alarm, and do not break and
charge until the continued firing and appearance of smoke
thoroughly alarms them. They perhaps think the noise is
thunder until the continued repetition disabuses them of the
idea.</p>

<p>Elephants, when standing in this undecided manner, are
liable to outbursts of fury if not treated in a certain way.
Sanderson says, “At such times no one should shout to turn
them, as a charge by one or more is sure to be made if
startled in this peculiar way. I have seen and experienced
several instances of the danger of this. In Chittagong, whilst
driving elephants into a stockade on one occasion, they approached
the guiding line of beaters too closely, when a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
who was behind a small bush shouted at them within thirty
yards. A female at once charged him. The man fell; and
with the pressure of her foot she split him open, and killed
him on the spot. This elephant had a very young calf, from
solicitude of which she became a perfect fury.”</p>

<p>Contrary to general belief, the single, or solitary, tuskers
afford the greatest sport. They are generally found away
from the herd before nine o’clock in the morning, and at this
time the hunter endeavors to find them. When a great distance
from a herd, the solitary elephant ceases feeding at
about ten, then stands listlessly a while under cover, and
finally lies down and goes to sleep. As a rule, it snores
quite loudly; the sound, which has a metallic ring to it,
coming from the trunk. Besides this, they often, perhaps
involuntarily, raise their upper ear, and let it fall with a
resounding slap upon the neck. All these sounds are well
known to the trackers; and, by them, they can tell just what
to expect, and how far away the game which is concealed in
the jungle is.</p>

<p>If a bed recently used is found by the trackers, they
immediately look for tusk-holes, or the impressions of the
tusks in the soil, made when the animal is lying down. If
they can put five fingers in the hole, they consider that the
tusks will weigh thirty pounds apiece, and are well worth
following.</p>

<p>Sanderson thus describes a hunt organized for his benefit
in the Billiga-rungun hills, not far from Mysore: “I kept my
eye on the tusker, who was in the middle of the line, and was
wondering how I could get a shot at his brain, when, as luck
would have it, some vegetable attraction overhead tempted
him, and he raised his head to reach it with his trunk. I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
beforehand fixed the fatal spot in my mind’s eye; and, catching
sight of his temple, I fired. For a moment I could see
nothing, for the smoke, but heard a tremendous commotion
amongst the elephants that were in company with the tusker.
Stepping a little aside, I saw their huge heads all turning
towards me, their ears outspread, and their trunks coiled up
in terrified astonishment. Being a novice in the sport, I felt
for the moment that I was in real danger. I stood my
ground however, determined, that, if any of them charged,
to fire at the foremost, and to run to Jaffer for the second
rifle: that failing, the case would have been rather bad.
However, charging was far from their thoughts: right about!
quick march! was more to their fancy; and with shrieks and
trumpets, away they went, some to the right, some to the
left, joined by the whole herd in one headlong race, up or
down the nullah. But my tusker remained stone dead upon
his knees. The triumph of such a success, utterly unassisted,
and in my first inexperienced attempt, quite transported me.
My bullet had reached the tusker’s brain: and, in sinking
down, he must have been supported by the bodies and legs
of the elephants between which he was wedged in; thus he
still remained on his knees, though quite dead. He retained
this kneeling position for some minutes, when, by a gradual
subsidence of the carcass, he heeled over, and fell heavily on
his side. I narrowly escaped being crushed between him and
the bank as he sank, just springing out of the way in time.
It would have been a fine thing indeed, if, after bagging my
first elephant, I had fallen a victim to the collapse of his
carcass.”</p>

<p>On one occasion, this hunter was following a herd, when
two Kurrabas ahead of him began to gesticulate furiously;
and, running ahead, he almost lost his life. He says, “Not
knowing what to make of this, except that there was an elephant
somewhere in the grass, I ran on, and almost fell into
an old and disused pitfall, which now contained an elephant.
His head was a little above the level of the ground. As I
stepped back quickly, he threw his fore-feet on to the bank,
and tried to reach me with his tusks. The whole occurrence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
was so sudden and unexpected, and his rush so startling, that
I instinctively pulled the trigger of my four-bore rifle from my
hip as I stepped back: there was no time to bring it to my
shoulder. The shot went through the base of his right tusk,
and buried itself deeply in his neck. He fell backwards;
but, recovering himself, he commenced dashing his head with
great violence against the sides of the pit in his stupefaction.
I therefore took a light gun from Jaffer, and killed him.”
The elephant had fallen into the pit some time before, and
the herd had immediately deserted it, as, says Sanderson,
they always do.</p>

<p>In following wild elephants, sportsmen often have favorable
opportunities to observe the habits and customs of the
great game in their native wilds; and on such an occasion a
fight between two tuskers was witnessed. Such an instance
is recorded in the following: “We ran towards the place
where the sounds of contest were increasing every moment:
a deep ravine at last only separated us from the combatants,
and we could see the tops of the bamboos bowing as the
monsters bore each other backwards and forwards with a
crashing noise in their tremendous struggles. As we ran
along the bank of the nullah to find a crossing, one elephant
uttered a deep roar of pain, and crossed the nullah some forty
yards in advance of us to our side. Here he commenced to
destroy a bamboo clump (the bamboos in these hills have a
very large hollow, and are weak and comparatively worthless)
in sheer fury, grumbling deeply the while with rage and
pain. Blood was streaming the while from a deep stab in
his left side high up. He was a very large elephant, with
long and fairly thick tusks, and with much white above the
forehead: the left tusk was some inches shorter than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
right. The opponent of this Goliath must have been a monster
indeed, to have worsted him.</p>

<p>“An elephant-fight, if the combatants are well matched,
frequently lasts for a day or more, a round being fought
every now and then. The beaten elephant retreats temporarily,
followed leisurely by the other, until, by mutual
consent, they meet again. The more powerful elephant occasionally
keeps his foe in view till he perhaps kills him: otherwise
the beaten elephant takes himself off for good on finding
he has the worst of it. Tails are frequently bitten off in
these encounters. This mutilation is common amongst rogue
elephants, and amongst the females in a herd. In the latter
case, it is generally the result of rivalry amongst themselves.</p>

<p>“The wounded tusker was evidently the temporarily beaten
combatant of the occasion; and I have seldom seen such a
picture of power and rage as he presented, mowing the bamboos
down with trunk and tusks, and bending the thickest
part over with his fore-feet. Suddenly his whole demeanor
changed: he backed from the clump, and stood like a statue.
Not a sound broke the stillness for an instant. His antagonist
was silent, wherever he was. Now the tip of his trunk
came slowly round in our direction, and I saw that we were
discovered to his fine sense of smell. We had been standing
silently behind a thin bamboo clump, watching him; and,
when I first saw that he had winded us, I imagined that he
might take himself off. But his frenzy quite overcame all
fear for the moment. Forward went his ears, and up went
his tail, in a way which no one who has once seen the signal
in a wild elephant can mistake the significance of; and in
the same instant he wheeled about with astonishing swiftness,
getting at once into full speed, and bore down upon us. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
bamboos, by which we were partly hidden, were useless as a
cover, and would have prevented a clear shot: so I slipped
out into open ground. The instant the elephant commenced
his charge, I gave a shout, hoping to stop him, which failed.
I had my No. 4 double smooth bore, loaded with ten drachms,
in hand. I fired when the elephant was about nine paces
off, aiming into his coiled trunk about one foot above the
fatal bump between the eyes; as his head was held very high,
and this allowance had to be made for its elevation. I felt
confident of the shot, but made a grand mistake in not giving
him both barrels. It was useless to reserve the left, as I did,
at such close quarters; and I deserved more than what followed
for doing so. The smoke from the ten drachms obscured
the elephant, and I stepped quickly to see where he lay.
Good Heavens! he had not been even checked, and was upon
me. There was no time to step to right or left. His tusks
came through the smoke (his head being now held low) like
the cow-catcher of a locomotive, and I had just time to fall
flat to avoid being hurled in front of him. I fell a little to
the right. The next instant down came his ponderous foot
within a few inches of my left thigh; and I should have been
trodden upon had I not been quick enough, when I saw the
fore-foot coming, to draw my leg from the sprawling position
in which I fell. As the elephant rushed over me, he shrieked
shrilly, which showed his trunk was uncoiled; and his head
also being held low, instead of in a charging position, I
rightly inferred that he was in full flight. Had he stopped,
I should have been caught; but the heavy bullet had taken
all the fight out of him. Jaffer had been disposed of by a
recoiling bamboo, and was now lying almost in the elephant’s
line. Fortunately, however, the brute held on. I was covered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
with blood from the wound inflicted by his late antagonist
in his left side: even my hair was matted together when
the blood became dry. How it was that I did not bag the
elephant, I can’t tell.”</p>

<p>A good idea of the excitement and sport of elephant-hunting
is obtained from the following account, from the pen of
Sir Victor Brooke, of a hunt participated in by him and Col.
Douglas Hamilton in the Billiga-rungun hills. The adventure
is particularly interesting, as the tusks were the largest
ever taken in India:—</p>

<p>“In July, 1863, Col. Douglas Hamilton and I were shooting in
the Hássanoor hills, Southern India. We had had
excellent sport, but, until the date of the death of the big
tusker, had not come across any elephants. Upon the morning of
that day, in the jungles to the east of the Hássanoor
bungalow, we had tracked up a fine tusker, which, partly
from over-anxiety, and partly, I must confess, from the effect
on my nervous system of the presence of the first wild bull
elephant I had ever seen, I failed to bag. About mid-day I
was lying on my bed, chewing the cud of vexation, and
inwardly vowing terrible vengeance on the next tusker I
might meet, when two natives came in to report a herd of
elephants in a valley some three or four miles to the north
of our camp. To prepare ourselves was the work of a few
seconds. As we arrived on the ridge overlooking the valley
where the elephants were, we heard the crackling of bamboos,
and occasionally caught sight of the track of an elephant as
it crossed a break amongst the confused mass of tree-tops
upon which we were gazing. Presently one of the elephants
trumpeted loudly, which attracted the attention of some people
herding cattle on the opposite side of the valley, who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
seeing us, and divining our intentions, yelled out, ‘<i>Ánay!
ánay!</i>’ (elephants) at the top of their voices, in the hope,
no doubt, of receiving reward for their untimely information.
The effect of these discordant human cries was magical.
Every matted clump seemed to heave and shake, and vomit
forth an elephant. With marvellous silence and quickness
the huge beasts marshalled themselves together; and, by the
time they appeared on the more open ground of the open
valley, a mighty cavalcade was formed, which, once seen, can
never be forgotten. There were about eighty elephants in
the herd. Towards the head of the procession was a noble
bull with a pair of tusks such as are seldom seen in India
nowadays. Following him in a direct line came a medley of
elephants of lower degree,—bulls, cows, and calves of every
size, some of the latter frolicking with comic glee, and running
in among the legs of their elders with the utmost confidence.
It was truly a splendid sight; and I really believe,
that, while it lasted, neither Col. Hamilton nor I entertained
any feeling but that of intense admiration and wonder. At
length this great exhibition was, we believed, over; and we
were commencing to arrange our mode of attack when that
hove in sight which called forth an ejaculation of astonishment
from each one of us. Striding along thoughtfully in
the rear of the herd, many of the members of which were
doubtless his children and his children’s children, came a
mighty bull, the like of which neither of my companions
after many years of jungle experience, nor the natives who
were with us, had ever seen before. But it was not merely
the stature of the noble beast that astonished us; for that,
though great, could not be considered unrivalled. It was
the sight of his enormous tusks, which projected like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
gleam of light through the grass, through which he was
slowly wending his way, that held us rooted to the spot.
With an almost solemn expression of countenance, Col.
Hamilton turned to me, and said, ‘There’s the largest tusker
in India, old boy; and, come what may, you must get him,
and take his tusk to Ireland with you.’ It was in vain that
I expostulated with my dear old friend, recalling my morning’s
mishap, and reminding him, that, in jungle laws, it
stands written, ‘Shot turn and turn about at elephants.’
It was of no avail. ‘You must bag that tusker,’ was all the
answer I could get.</p>

<p>“It took us but a short time to run down the slope, and
to find the track which swept like a broad avenue along the
bed of the valley. Cautiously we followed it up, and, after
about a quarter of a mile, came upon the elephants. They
were standing in perfect silence around the borders of a
small glade, in the middle of which stood the great tusker,
quite alone, and broadside to us. He was about fifty yards
from us, and therefore out of all elephant-shooting range;
but the difficulty was to shorten the distance. The approach
direct was impossible, owing to the absolute want of
cover: so, after some deliberation, we decided on working
to the right, and endeavoring to creep up behind a solitary
tree, which stood about twenty yards behind the elephant.
When within ten yards of this tree, we found to our annoyance
a watchful old cow, who was not farther than fifteen
yards from us, and to our right, and had decided suspicions
of our proximity. To attempt to gain another foot would
have been to run the risk of disturbing the elephants. Seeing
this, and knowing the improbability of our ever getting
the bull outside the herd again, Col. Hamilton recommended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
me to creep a little to the left, so as to get the shot behind
his ear, and to try the effect of my big Purdy rifle, while he
kept his eye on the old cow in case her curiosity should
induce her to become unpleasant. I should mention that we
now, for the first time, perceived that the old bull had only
one perfect tusk, the left one being a mere stump, projecting
but little beyond the upper lip. I accordingly followed Col.
Hamilton’s instructions. At the shot, the old bull, with a
shrill trumpet of pain and rage, swung around on his hind-legs
as on a pivot, receiving my second barrel, and two from
Col. Hamilton. This staggered the old fellow dreadfully;
and, as he stood facing us, Col. Hamilton ran up within
twelve yards of him with a very large single-bore rifle, and
placed a bullet between his eyes. Had the rifle been as
good as it was big, I believe this would have ended the fray;
but, though its shock produced a severe momentary effect,
the bullet had, as we afterwards ascertained, only penetrated
three or four inches into the cancellous tissue of the frontal
bone. After swaying backwards and forwards for a moment
or two, during which I gave him both barrels of my second
rifle, the grand old beast seemed to rally all his forces, and,
rolling up his trunk, and sticking his tail in the air, rushed
off trumpeting, and whistling like a steam-engine.</p>

<p>“Col. Hamilton followed, and fired two more barrel-shots,
while I remained behind to reload the empty rifles. This
completed, I joined my friend, whom I found standing in
despair at the edge of a small ravine overgrown with tangled
underwood, into which the tusker had disappeared. For
some little time I found it difficult to persuade Col. Hamilton
to continue the chase. Long experience had taught him how
rarely elephants once alarmed are met with a second time the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
same day. At length, however, finding that I was determined
to follow the tracks of the noble beast until I lost
them, even should it involve sleeping upon them, my gallant
old friend gave way, and entered eagerly into a pursuit which
at the time he considered almost, if not absolutely, useless.
It would be tedious, even if it were possible, to describe all
the details of the long, stern chase which followed. After
emerging from the thorny ravine into which the elephant had
disappeared, the tracks led over a series of extensive open
grassy glades, crossed the Mysore-Hássanoor road beyond the
seventh milestone, and then followed the deep, sandy bed
of a dry river for a considerable distance. At length, when
about nine weary miles had been left behind us, we began to
remark signs of the elephant having relaxed a little in its
direct onward flight. His tracks commenced to zigzag backwards
and forwards in an undecided manner, and finally led
down a steep, grassy slope into a densely matted, thorny jungle
bordering a small stream at its foot. I was the first to
arrive at the edge of the thicket, and without waiting for my
companions, who were out of sight, followed the tracks cautiously
into it. I soon found that it was almost impossible
to track the elephant any farther. The entire thicket was
traversed by a perfect labyrinth of elephant-paths, and on
each path were more or less recent footprints of elephants.
Giving up the idea of tracking for a moment, I was on the
point of commencing a further exploration of the thicket,
when a low hiss attracted my attention; and, looking around,
I saw a native who had accompanied us, beckoning to me,
and gesticulating to me in the most frantic manner. Upon
going to him, he pointed eagerly in front of him; and, following
the direction of his finger, my eyes alighted, not on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
elephant as I expected, but upon Col. Hamilton, who, from
behind the trunk of a small tree, was gazing intently towards
the little stream, which ran not more than thirty yards from
where he was standing. With the greatest care I stole to his
side. ‘There he is, in front of you, standing in the stream.
You had better take him at once, or he will be off again,’
were the welcome words which greeted my ears. At the
same moment my eyes were gratified by the indistinct outline
of the mighty bull, who, already suspicious of danger,
was standing perfectly motionless in the middle of the stream,
which was so narrow that the branches of the low bamboos
on its banks nearly met across it. The distance, twenty-seven
yards, was too great for certainty: but there was no
choice; as, even if the elephant had been utterly unaware of
our vicinity, the tangled, thorny nature of the dense jungle
surrounding him would have rendered it impossible to approach
nearer without discovery. As it was, the perfect
immobility of all save his eye, and every now and then the
quickly altered position of his tattered ears, showed undeniably
that the chances of flight and battle were being weighed
in the massive head, and that there was no time to lose.
Covering the orifice of the ear with as much ease as if the
shot had been at an egg at a hundred yards, I fired. A
heavy crash, and the sudden expulsion of the stream from
its bed ten or twelve feet into the air, followed the report;
and I have a dim recollection of my old friend hugging me
the next minute in his delight while he exclaimed, ‘Splendid,
old boy! he’s dead, and the biggest tusker ever killed in
India.’ But our work was not over yet. With one or two
tremendous lurches from side to side, the old bull regained
his feet, but only to be again felled by my second barrel, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
this time to rise no more. The shades of evening were closing
in fast, and a long journey lay between us and home, so
we had but a few moments to admire the grandest trophy
it has ever fallen to the lot of a sportsman to secure.”</p>

<p>This hunt not only shows the endurance required, but the
remarkable faculty of the elephant in travelling great distances
when so desperately wounded, and the necessity of
the heaviest ammunition to prevent prolonged suffering in
the noble animals. When an elephant has been shot in the
manner described by Sir Victor, the tusks are secured as
trophies, and sometimes the head and other parts. They are
either cut out with an axe, or left for ten or twelve days,
when they can be easily drawn out of the alveole. The
lowest Mysore inhabitants will not eat elephant flesh, though
they have no objection to carrion; but the Chittagong hill
people eat it with avidity. The tail is also used as a trophy;
while the feet are taken and upholstered as footstools, and presented
to the sportsman’s lady friends. The feet of calves
are converted into cigar-boxes, for the fortunate hunter’s
gentleman acquaintances; while tobacco-boxes, inkstands,
and various articles are also made as mementoes of the
hunt.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WHITE ELEPHANT.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Mention of the white elephant is found in the very
early histories of Oriental countries. In a work
called the “Mahaw Anso,” the animal is described as
forming a part of the retinue attached to the Temple of
the Tooth at Anarájapoora in the fifth century after Christ;
but it commanded no religious veneration, being merely considered
as an emblem of royalty.</p>

<p>White elephants were so valued in the sixteenth century,
that the nations of Pegu and Siam waged a war for many
years about one; and, before it was settled, five successive
kings were killed, and thousands of men.</p>

<p>Horace mentions the white elephant in his “Epistles.”
Democritus would laugh at the populace,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whether a beast of mixed and monstrous birth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bids them with gaping admiration gaze,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or a white elephant their wonder raise.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Ælian refers to a white elephant whose mother was black.
In the eleventh century Mahmood possessed one, and when
mounted upon it in battle he felt assured of victory.</p>

<p>The question whether the white elephant was worshipped,
or is at the present time, in Burmah or Siam, is of considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
interest; and authorities vary so, that the seeker after
information is often puzzled. I think that the status of the
animal may be fairly expressed in the following.</p>

<p>By the most intelligent and refined Burmese and Siamese,
it is merely considered as an invaluable adjunct to royalty.
It is an important part of the retinue of a court; and its
presence is considered a lucky omen, this superstition having
an extremely strong hold upon the princes and kings.
The lower classes in some cases may have worshipped the
white elephant, and the attention paid to it by royalty may
have easily been misunderstood by the uneducated as
reverence.</p>

<p>The fact that the white elephant is mentioned in the
mythology of the countries, and associated with Buddha,
shows that it was undoubtedly reverenced if not worshipped
by some; and, if the veneration had not its source in religious
feeling, it was so nearly akin to it that it amounted to
the same thing.</p>

<p>The Siamese are extremely superstitious; but, before we
condemn them, we must remember how many of our sailors
refuse to sail on Friday. How a broken mirror or spilled
salt alarms many otherwise intelligent Americans! so that,
when we learn from Major Snodgrass that in his time in
Burmah a mere grunt from the white elephant was supposed
to have some important significance, we need not be surprised.
Any extraordinary movement or noise made by the
animal was quite enough at this time to interrupt the most
important affairs, and to cause the most solemn engagement
to be broken. Crawford thinks this was merely superstition,
and says, “I had here an opportunity, as well as in Siam, of
ascertaining that the veneration paid to the white elephant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
had been in some respects greatly exaggerated. The white
elephant <i>is not</i> an object of worship, but it is considered an
indispensable part of the regalia of sovereignty. Royalty is
incomplete without it; and, the more there are, the more
perfect is the state of the kingly office considered. Both the
court and the people would consider it as peculiarly inauspicious
to want a white elephant, and hence the repute in
which they are held. The lower orders, however, it must be
observed, perform the “shiko, or obedience of submission,”
to the white elephant; but the chiefs view this as a vulgar
superstition, and do not follow it.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, Vincent states that the white elephant
has been happily termed the Apis of the Buddhists. “It is
held to be sacred by all the Indo-Chinese nations except the
Annamese. It is revered as a god while living, and its
death is regarded as a national calamity.... Even at the
present day the white elephant is worshipped by the lower
classes; but by the king and nobles it is revered and valued
not so much for its divine character, being the abode of a
transmigrating Buddha, as because it is believed to bring
prosperity to the court in peace, and good fortune in war.
The more there are of them, the more grand and powerful
the state is supposed to be.”</p>

<p>From this somewhat conflicting statement, we may infer
that the white elephant was formerly worshipped; but, at the
present day, the estimate that I have given may be applied.</p>

<p>The association of the white elephant with the religious
sects of India is well known; but how much it was reverenced
from the association, it is impossible to tell. Sir John
Bowring gives the following reasons for believing that the
animal was held sacred, principally, “because it is believed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
that Buddha, the divine emanation from the Deity, must
necessarily, in his multitudinous metamorphoses, or transmissions
through all existences, and through millions of æons,
delight to abide for some time in that grand incarnation of
purity which is represented by the white elephant.” While
the <i>bonzes</i> teach that there is no spot in the heavens above,
or the earth below, or the waters under the earth, which is
not visited in the peregrinations of the divinity,—whose
every stage or step is towards purification,—they hold that
his tarrying may be longer in the white elephant than in any
other abode, and that, in the possession of the sacred creatures,
they may possess the presence of Buddha himself.
It is known that the Singhalese have been kept in subjection
by the belief that their rulers have a tooth of Buddha in the
Temple of Kandy and that, on various tracts of the East,
impressions of the foot of Buddha are reverenced, and are
the objects of weary pilgrimages to places which can only be
reached with difficulty: but with the white elephant some
vague notions of a vital Buddha are associated, and there can
be no doubt that the marvellous sagacity of the creature has
served to strengthen their religious prejudices. Siamese are
known to whisper their secrets into an elephant’s ear, and to
ask a solution of their perplexities by some sign or movement.
And most assuredly there is more sense and reason
in the worship of an intelligent beast than in that of stocks
and stones, the work of men’s hands.</p>

<p>Kircher says that “the veneration which, in the Burman
Empire, is paid to the white elephant, is in some degree connected
with the doctrine of metempsychosis. Xaca sustained
seventy thousand transmigrations through various animals,
and rested in the white elephant.” Hindoo mythology<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
teaches that the earth is supported by eight elephants; and
that this was believed, is shown by Bernier, who witnessed
a dialogue between an aga at the court of Delhi, and a Pundit
Brahmin. The harangue concluded with these words:
“When, my lord, you place your foot in the stirrup, marching at
the head of your cavalry, the earth trembles under
your footsteps; the eight elephants, on whose heads it is
borne, finding it impossible to support the extraordinary
pressure.”</p>

<p>In the Rámáyana, one of the most celebrated sacred books
of the Brahmins, is a very curious account of the journey of
a party of men who penetrated to the interior of the earth,
and had an audience with the famous elephants. It will be
seen from the following, that the white elephant is an important

<p>“The sixty thousand descended to Patala, and there renewed
their digging. There, O chief of men! they saw the
elephant of that quarter of the globe, in size resembling a
mountain, with distorted eyes, supporting with his head this
earth, with its mountains and forests, covered with various
countries, and adorned with numerous cities. When, for the
sake of rest, O Kakootstha! the great elephant, through distress,
refreshes himself by moving his head, an earthquake is
produced. Having respectfully circumambulated this mighty
elephant, guardian of the quarter, they, O Rama! fearing
him, penetrated into Patala. After they had thus penetrated
the east quarter, they opened their way to the south.
Here they saw that great elephant Muhapudma, equal to a
huge mountain, sustaining the earth with his head. Beholding him,
they were filled with surprise; and, after the usual
circumambulation, the sixty thousand sons of the great Sugura<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
perforated the west quarter. In this, these mighty ones
saw the elephant Soumanuca, of equal size. Having respectfully
saluted him, and inquired respecting his health, these
valiant men, digging, arrived at the north. In this quarter,
O chief of Ruzhoo! they saw the snow-white elephant
Bhudra, supporting this earth with his beautiful body.”</p>

<p>The Persians have, according to Chardin, a festival in
honor of the inspiration of an elephant, when Abraha, a
prince of Yemen, marched an army to destroy the Kaaba of
Mecca, the sacred oratory which Abraham built in that city.
Prior to the birth of Mohammed, the Arabians reckoned from
this epoch, which they called the year of the coming of the
elephants. The tradition is thus told in Sale’s Koran: “The
Meccans, at the approach of so considerable a host, retired to
the neighboring mountains, being unable to defend their city
or temple. But God himself undertook the defence of both.
For when Abraha drew near to Mecca, and would have entered it,
the elephant on which he rode, which was a very
large one, and named Mahmud, refused to advance any
nigher to the town, but knelt down whenever they endeavored to
force him that way, though he would rise and march
briskly enough if they turned him towards any other quarter:
and while matters were in this posture, on a sudden, a
large flock of birds, like swallows, came flying from the sea-coast,
every one of which carried three stones, one in each
foot, and one in its bill; and these stones they threw down
upon the heads of Abraha’s men, certainly killing every one
they struck.”</p>

<p>In many old works, reference is made to the fact that the
elephant was a religious animal. Kircher, in his description
of China, gives a plate showing a white elephant worshipping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
the sun and moon, which was copied from the Chinese. It
was supposed that all elephants worshipped the sun. Pliny
says, “We find in him qualities which are rare enough
amongst men,—honesty, prudence, equity, religion also, in
his worship of the sun and moon. Authors say, that, in the
forests of Mauritania, the elephants, at the sight of the new
moon, descend in troops to a certain river called Anelo,
where they solemnly wash themselves, and, having rendered
their homage to the star, return to the woods, supporting the
young ones that are fatigued.”</p>

<p>According to Vincent, in Pali Scriptures it is duly set
forth “that the form under which Buddha will descend to
the earth for the last time, will be that of a beautiful young
white elephant, open-jawed, with a head the color of cochineal,
with tusks shining like silver sparkling with gems,
covered with a splendid netting of gold, perfect in organs
and limbs, and majestic in appearance.”</p>

<p>It would seem from the above, that there was at least little
doubt that among some classes in ancient times the white elephant
was worshipped. The term white is deceptive. The
pure white elephant figured on the arms and flag of Siam
has conveyed the impression that the Siamese and Burmese
possessed pure white proboscidians; but this is a gross error.
A pure white elephant probably never existed, at least was
never captured. All the so-called sacred elephants of the
present and former days possessed very few characteristics
to distinguish them from ordinary elephants to be met with
any day in Bombay. Mr. Barnum’s white elephant is an exceptionally
fine example, being whiter than many owned in
Siam, and much more so than the late white elephant of
Theebaw. In fact, the white elephant is not white at all, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
term being applied to any elephant who shows the slightest
evidence of albinism. There are two terms applied to abnormally
white or black animals,—albinism and melanism. The
former is given to animals, including men, who have a deficient
supply of coloring matter; while the latter is associated
with those who have an excess of pigment. Men and women
with white hair and pink eyes, the white rabbit, etc., represent
the albino phase; and the white elephant belongs to this
category, being simply an ordinary elephant, who, to a greater
or less extent, lacks coloring matter; and, as a result, it is
often a dark mouse color, a little lighter than the ordinary
elephant, and has numerous pinkish splashes about the head,
or on various parts of the body. The eyes in some are pink;
and the toe-nails, when scraped, are perhaps some lighter,
and in some cases a yellowish white. The blotches of the
white elephant are not hereditary. It is the offspring of
black parents, and the condition does not affect the health
of the animal in any way.</p>

<p>In India, the white elephant is not appreciated; but the
Singhalese are fond of elephants having the pink blotches
which constitute a white elephant in Siam or Burmah; and
they are liable to be found in any elephant country.</p>

<p>While we assume that the white elephant is not worshipped
or revered by the nobles of Siam and Burmah of the present
day, the honor that is paid it is somewhat astonishing. Thus,
the King of Cambodia, who claims that his ancestors owned
seventy thousand elephants, is called the “first cousin of
the white elephant;” the prime minister of Siam, “general
of the elephants;” the foreign minister of Cochin China,
“mandarin of elephants;” while the late Theebaw and the
King of Siam enjoyed the distinction of being called “lord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
of the celestial elephant,” and “master of many white elephants.”</p>

<p>The animal appears upon various objects, as the national
emblem, the coat of arms, medals, the buttons of officials, etc.
The late white elephant of Theebaw held a high rank and
position at court, taking precedence of the heir-apparent; or,
assuming it to have been connected with the British court,
it would have been given precedence before the Prince of
Wales.</p>

<p>The Order of the White Elephant is one of the most
honorable conferred, and few have received it. Among them
is Edward Arnold, author of “The Light of Asia;” and it
was reported some time before the Burmese war, that the
King of Siam was about to visit England for the sole purpose
of conferring it upon Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>The following is a copy of the parchment which accompanied
the one conferred upon Mr. Arnold. It is beautifully executed
in gold, red, and black, and is a curiosity in
itself:—</p>

<p class="right">(MANU REGIÂ) CHULALOUKORU, R.S.</p>

</div>

<p>Queen Victoria has, I believe, not yet received the order;
but she is not unacquainted with the veneration entertained
by the Siamese for the animal, as the following will show.
Some years ago she sent an embassy to the kingdom of Siam,
consisting of several noblemen and officers of rank, to conduct
some diplomatic business; and, according to custom,
they carried some valuable presents to the king. Upon their
return, the latter, not wishing to be outdone by the Queen,
delivered to Sir John Bowring a gold box locked with a gold
key, containing the most valuable gift he could devise. Sir
John, naturally thinking it a gem, perhaps of great price, bore
it carefully from Siam to England, and personally presented
it to her Majesty. Doubtless there was some curiosity in the
royal mind to know what was so precious as to require a
solid gold box and key; but it was not a gem,—though it
may have been in the eyes of the Siamese monarch,—and
was simply a few hairs taken from the king’s white elephant!</p>

<p>A Siamese ambassador, during a visit to London, thus
referred to Queen Victoria in language intended to be highly
flattering: “One cannot but be struck with the aspect of the
august Queen of England, or fail to observe that she must
be of pure descent from a race of goodly and warlike kings
and rulers of the earth, in that her eyes, complexion, and,
above all, her bearing, are those of a beautiful and majestic
white elephant.”</p>

<p>As these pink-splashed elephants are so esteemed, it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
to be wondered at that there is constant search for them in
the jungle; and the fortune of him is made who discovers
one. They are, however, comparatively rare; and in thirteen
hundred and fifty-two years, between A.D. 515 and 1867, only
twenty-four were captured, making about one in every fifty-six
years. The last one was captured in 1885, and was conducted
to the court of the King of Siam by His Royal Highness
Somdetch Chowf Mahamalah Bamrahp Parapako, amid
much parade. His Majesty accepted it, and made the fortunate
finder, a poor native, a present of a sum of money, as
well as his mother and son. The Siamese officials who brought
the elephant to Bangkok, were honored with an audience by
His Majesty, and also given valuable presents.</p>

<p>In former days the ceremonies attending the capture of a
white elephant were very impressive. The discoverer, were
he the humblest man in the kingdom, was immediately made
a mandarin: he was exempted from taxation for the remainder
of his life, and presented with large sums of money, the
king himself giving him one thousand dollars. As soon as
the capture was made, a special courier was despatched to
the king, and a posse of nobles with gifts and robes started
immediately for the scene of action. The ropes which the
captors used in binding the royal victim were replaced by
stout cords of scarlet silk. Mandarins attended to the slightest
wants of the animal. Rich feather-fans with gilt handles
were used to keep the insects from it during the day, while a
silk embroidered mosquito-net was provided at night. To
remove it to the capital, a boat was built especially for the
purpose, and a magnificent canopy erected over it, ornamented
and bedecked as were the king’s palaces. Silk draperies,
heavy with gold and silver, enclosed the royal prisoner;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
and in this state he floated down the river, receiving the
acclamations of the people. When near the city, it was
landed, the king and his court going out to meet and escort
it to the city, where a place had been built for it within the
royal palace-grounds. A large tract of land was set apart
for his country-place, chosen from the best the kingdom
afforded. A cabinet of ministers was appointed, and a large
retinue of other nobles, to attend to its wants. The priest
of the king was ordered to administer to its spiritual needs,
and it had physicians to see to its physical requirements.
Gold and silver dishes were supplied to feed it from, and
every want was attended to as became one of the royal family.
The city devoted three days to festivities, and the rich
mandarins made it rare presents.</p>

<p>When a white elephant died, the ceremonies were the same
as those of a king or queen. The body lay in state for several
days; and then it was placed upon a funeral pyre, and
cremated. This pyre often cost thousands of dollars, being
made of the choicest sandal, sassafras, and other valuable
woods. After the body had been thoroughly cremated, it
was allowed to remain three days more; then the ashes were
collected, and placed in costly urns, and buried in the royal
cemetery, a magnificent mausoleum being erected over the
spot.</p>

<p>A friend of the author, who visited the land of the white
elephant a few years ago, states that, when he observed a white
elephant, about twenty natives were standing around, whom
he was informed by the guide were mandarins and nobles of
the highest class, who formed the cabinet of the elephant: in
fact, they were a body selected for their dignity and rank.
One was chief minister of the cabinet, and the others held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
different offices. Other nobles were attached directly to the
person of his celestial highness. One fed him with bananas
and rare fruits difficult to obtain: another gently brushed
away the flies from its head, and created a breeze. About
the room were various objects which bespoke its royal nature.
The ropes, umbrellas, and blankets were of the finest description,
many being ornamented with seeming gems. Later he
witnessed the ceremony of the bath; and no spectacle, he said,
that he had ever observed in America, began to compare with
it. The entire city seemed to turn out and make a holiday
of the occasion. When the march was taken up, the elephant
stepped out heavily caparisoned. Elegant silks,
trimmed with scarlet, silver, white, and gold, depended from
its back: over its head was held the royal umbrella, a gorgeous
affair, supported by gilded rods held in the hands of
eight mandarins, four of whom marched on each side. On
the animal’s tusks were bands of solid gold; and as he
moved solemnly along, surrounded by other nobles, his ministers,
and attendants, all in rich garbs, with a shouting but
respectful crowd all about it, it was certainly an impressive
and wonderful sight. At the river the trappings were taken
off, and the elephant plunged in and enjoyed himself after
the manner of plebeian elephants. When the bath was finished,
its feet were re-washed, and dried on a silken towel:
the silks and rich stuffs were then replaced, a band of music
struck up, and the procession took up the return march.
Once at court, the newly captured white elephant is honored by
titles which are conferred upon him by the king,
some of which are “Gem of the Sky,” “Glory of the Land,”
“Radiance of the World,” “Leveller of the Earth,” etc.</p>

<p>The king often took advantage of the capture of an elephant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
to replenish the royal treasury; and, when the animal
was housed in the palace, an invitation was sent out to the
rich merchants to come and pay their respects. This meant
literally to make presents to the white elephant, which, of
course, were used by the king. People who wished to obtain
favors from His Majesty, took this occasion to offer valuable
gifts. In some cases, it was money; in others, objects of art;
and one present was a vase of solid gold weighing four hundred
and eighty ounces.</p>

<p>Zachard, an old traveller, saw a white elephant in Siam
which was said to be over two hundred years old, over which
there had been much blood shed. It lived in a magnificent
pavilion, and had one hundred attendants, who fed it from
vessels of gold. When Mr. Crawford was in Siam, the king
had six white elephants; and the King of Ava possessed
only one, which was fastened directly in front of the palace.
While Mr. Crawford was in Ava, a report was sent to the
king that a white elephant had been captured, but it could
not be forwarded without the destruction of ten thousand
baskets of rice. To which the king replied, “What signifies
the destruction of ten thousand baskets of rice in comparison
with the possession of a white elephant!” and the order
for the beast was immediately given.</p>

<p>The white elephant now in the possession of the King of
Ava, who styles himself “Lord of the White Elephant,” is,
according to Vincent, a vicious brute of medium size, with
white eyes, and the forehead and ears spotted white (pink),
appearing as if they had been rubbed with pumice stone
or sand-paper; but the remainder of the body is as black
as coal. The animal is kept chained in the centre of a pavilion,
surrounded by the adjuncts of royalty, which consist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
of gold and white cloth umbrellas, an embroidered canopy,
a bundle of spears, dishes, etc. Mr. Vincent was informed
that a young white elephant had recently been captured in
the north-eastern part of British Burmah, near Tounghoo;
but it died, and the king had been “out of sorts” ever
since.</p>

<p>Mr. Vincent also inspected the white elephants at Bangkok,
and found them fastened to posts in large sheds, covered
with gilt canopies very much as were those at Mandalay.
The keeper fed the animals with bananas in his presence,
and caused the Apis of Buddha, as they call the animal, to
salute an American, probably for the first time. The salaam,
or salutation, consisted in raising the proboscis to the forehead,
and then lowering it slowly and gracefully to the
ground.</p>

<p>With these white elephants were several white monkeys,
which were kept to ward off evil spirits. White animals of
all kinds are considered abodes of transmigrating souls by
Buddhists. Sir John Bowring saw the white monkey honored
with special attention. The veneration received by white
elephants may perhaps be explained by the fact that all
white animals are believed to be the abiding-place of some
mighty Buddha; and by possessing such an animal, having
the deity in the family, as it were, they may receive any
advantages that may accrue from the association.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, with the downfall of the infamous
Theebaw came that of his white elephant. The king left
Mandalay, Nov. 29, 1885, accompanied by his queen, Soopyalot.
The day the city fell, the white elephant died; and its
body was dragged out of the palace-yard by the British
troops on the following day. It was reported that the king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
ordered its destruction rather than have such a prize fall into
the hands of the British.</p>

<p>This elephant, which was no whiter than the Barnum
specimen, lived in great pomp in the palace enclosure, eating
and drinking out of huge silver buckets.</p>

<p>The finest white elephant caught in late years is described
by Mr. Carl Bock, who states that it was brought into Bangkok
with all the pomp and ceremony of an emperor.
According to Mr. Bock, it was quite an albino, the whole
body being of a pale reddish-brown color, with a few white
hairs on the back. The iris of the eye, the color of which is
held to be a good test of an albino, was a pale Naples yellow.
The animal was blessed and baptized in presence of the king
and the nobility. One of the high priests presented it with
a piece of sugar-cane, on which was written the elephant’s
name in full, and which it very readily ate. The following
is a translation of its description painted on a red tablet,
hung over one of the pillars of its stall: “An elephant of
beautiful color; hair, nails, and eyes are white. Perfection
in form, with all signs of regularity of the high family. The
color of the skin is that of lotos. A descendant of the
angels of the Brahmins. Acquired as property by the power
and glory of the king for his service. Is equal to the crystal
of the highest value. Is of the highest family of all in existence.
A source of power of attraction of rain. It is as
pure as the purest crystal of the highest value in the world.”</p>

<p>As the white elephant is so highly esteemed in the Oriental
countries, it would be surprising if obstacles were not laid in
the way of their being taken to foreign lands. Hence a white
elephant was never seen in a Western country before the advent
of Mr. Barnum’s now famous Toung Taloung, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
passage from its native country to America was highly
exciting and dramatic.</p>

<p>The first white elephant ever seen out of its native land
was one that was exhibited in Holland in 1633. The second
was the Barnum elephant, which was brought to England in
1884, and from there shipped to America.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Sir John Bowring states that it is almost impossible to put
a price upon a white elephant; and he mentions fifty thousand
dollars as a sum that might buy one; adding that a
single hair from the tail of a white elephant was worth a
Jew’s ransom. The Barnum white elephant, it is said, cost
two hundred thousand dollars by the time it was landed in
America,—probably the most expensive pachyderm that
ever lived. The agents sent to Siam and Burmah by Mr.
Barnum had instructions to obtain the finest white elephant
that money could buy. They crossed the Pacific, sailed
down the coast of China, and finally reached Siam, where
they endeavored to gain an interview with the first king.
By him they were referred to the second, who indignantly
refused their offer to purchase one of the white elephants.
Some of the people, hearing of it, became enraged; and the
men narrowly escaped injury. For months they followed up
various clews, but at last found an elephant owned by the
estate of a nobleman, whose widow agreed to part with
the animal, which to her was an expensive luxury. Finally
all arrangements were made; and the elephant was placed in
a boat, and floated down the Irrawaddy to Rangoon. At
almost every village they had difficulty, the people seeming
to have a strong objection to the creature leaving the
country: finally some fanatical natives secreted themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
in the steamer, and, it is believed, poisoned the noble
animal, for it died suddenly before reaching Singapore. I
have seen photographs of it, and the tusks are now in the
possession of Mr. J. H. Hutchinson of New York. The elephant
was, if any thing, a finer specimen than Toung Taloung.</p>

<p>The white-elephant hunters became so discouraged, that
they returned home, but were, however, sent out again, and
went through almost a repetition of their former experience.
Through the influence of some English residents, they finally
secured a typical white elephant. The permission of King
Theebaw was essential before it could leave the country, and
this was obtained with the condition that the white elephant
should always receive the same attention that it did in
Burmah. This was readily consented to, as it was to Mr.
Barnum’s interest to exhibit the animal with the same surroundings
that characterized its life in Siam. The following
is the bill of sale sworn to by H. Porter, Esq., notary public
at Rangoon:—</p>

<p>In the year 1245, month of Ta Sung Mong, fifth increase at Mandalay,
I, Moung Thee, minister of royal elephants, hereby certify that the elephant

<p>Other papers and testimonials from prominent people
accompanied these documents, testifying to its identity; and,
every thing being in readiness, the march was commenced
from Mandalay overland to Rangoon, a distance of seven
hundred miles. This trip was one of no little danger. They
were continually stopped in native towns; and rumors followed
them to the effect that King Theebaw had changed
his mind, fearing that ill luck would follow the loss of one
of the animals. But finally the little band, which consisted
of several white men and natives, Toung Taloung, and four
black elephants, upon which were three white monkeys, the
images of the Buddhist god Gautama, the golden umbrellas,
etc., reached the Irrawaddy River, four hundred miles from
Mandalay. In one village they were nearly mobbed; in
another imprisoned, and a lawsuit commenced. But finally
they were released; and the white elephant was placed on
the steamer “Tenasserim,” and, guarded day and night,
crossed the Bay of Bengal, and safely reached Liverpool,
from where it was shipped to the United States. I was invited
to go down the bay on the special steamer to be among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
the first to see a white elephant on American shores; and I
well remember the smile of satisfaction that illumined the
face of the genial Barnum, when an ex-United-States minister
to one of the Eastern countries, who was of the party, spoke
up, and said, as we all stood around the sacred beast in the
hold of the “Lydian Monarch,” “I have seen all the white
elephants of the kings of Burmah and Siam, and consider
this an exceptionally fine example of what is known as the
sacred white elephant.”</p>

<p>The general public, however, expected to see a pure white
elephant, and naturally much criticism was provoked. I
believe that Mr. Barnum now claims as much credit in educating
the American public as to what constitutes a white
elephant, as he did in bringing the historic animal from its
native country.</p>

<p>Toung Taloung is a finely formed elephant, about eight
feet in height, with perfect and finely developed tusks three
feet in length. Its nails are ivory-lined, and its general color
a light gray, which presents some contrast to ordinary elephants.
Upon the head, trunk, and ears are several pink
blotches, white by courtesy, or, rather, because King Theebaw
chose to consider them so.</p>

<p>Toung Taloung has a mild and peaceful disposition, and
does not object in the slightest to being fed upon delicacies,
and waited upon by native attendants. He is now about
sixteen years old.</p>

<p>A second so-called white elephant, the “Light of Asia,”
was imported into this country by Adam Forepaugh of
Philadelphia soon after the advent of Toung Taloung. It is
a male, about seven years old, and a little over five feet in
height, its tusks just appearing.</p>

<p>While the elephant of Ceylon does not differ specifically
from its cousins of Continental India, there are
certain facts of interest about it that would seem to warrant
special attention. In 1847, according to Tennent, they were
found over nearly the entire island, with the exception of a
narrow but densely inhabited belt of cultivated land that
extends along the seaboard from Chilaw on the Western
coast to Tangalle on the south-east: this is, to some extent,
true to-day, their great tracks being found in forests and
plains where the surroundings are adapted to their requirements.
There has, however, been a noticeable diminution
of their numbers in certain localities.</p>

<p>Thus, Le Brun, who visited Ceylon in 1705, says that then
they were very abundant in the country about Colombo, and
that he had seen one hundred and sixty at a time in a corral.
It is also known, that, in olden times, it was necessary in
some localities to keep fires burning at night, in order to
keep them away from the rice-fields. The opening up of the
country, and the clearing off of the mountain forests of
Kandy by coffee-planters, has also restricted their range;
while sportsmen and others have greatly reduced their
numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>From the date of the first Punic war, the natives have
been aware of their value, and have captured them to send
to India for various purposes,—formerly for use in war, and
to-day as laborers in the great lumber-yards, and in other
positions where great strength is required.</p>

<p>The number of elephants exported from Ceylon between
the years 1863 and 1876 was sixteen hundred and fifty-seven,
a showing that has no comparison with Africa.
The Ceylon elephants are remarkable for the absence of
tusks. So marked is this, a Ceylon elephant with these
sexual weapons is something of a curiosity, not one in
a hundred having them, and then only the males being
the fortunate possessors. They are not totally unarmed;
as nearly all have stunted tusks, generally about a foot
in length, and two inches in diameter. With these they
loosen earth, strip the bark from trees, and tear down
climbing-plants. That the tusks are in general use, is
shown by the fact that nearly all have a groove worn in
the extremities.</p>

<p>Many ingenious theories have been advanced to explain
this lack of development. The most feasible explanation
would seem to be, that, in Ceylon, the elephants had less
use for weapons of defence than on the main-land.</p>

<p>The Ceylon elephant leads a quiet, pastoral life compared
to its ally of Africa, who, if not attacked, is menaced by
rhinoceros and lion; while the tiger, though not the master
of the Asiatic elephant, infuses it with a wholesome dread,
and will attack it if the true king of beasts is at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>In the chapter on Continental Asiatic Elephants, the distinguishing
points of elephants are given. In Ceylon, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
differ again; and in a Singhalese work, the “Hastisilpe,”
which treats of the management of these animals, the author
says an inferior elephant (one that corresponds probably to
the Meerga caste) has “eyes restless like those of a crow, the
hair of the head mixed shades, the nails short and green,
the ears small, the neck thin, the skin freckled, the tail
without a tuft, and the fore-quarters lean and low.” The
perfect type, corresponding to the Koomeriah grade of India,
is characterized by “softness of the skin, the red color of the
mouth and tongue, the forehead expanded and hollow, the
ears broad and rectangular, the trunk broad at the root, and
blotched with pink in front, the eyes bright and kindly, the
cheeks large, the neck full, the back level, the chest square,
the fore-legs short, and convex in front, the hindquarter
plump, and five nails on each foot, all smooth, polished, and
round.” An elephant with these perfections, says the same
author, “will impart glory and magnificence to the king: but
he cannot be discovered among thousands; yea, there shall
never be found an elephant clothed at once with all the
excellences here described.”</p>

<p>The noises which Ceylon elephants utter, while undoubtedly
identical with those of India and Bengal, seem to have
a rather different meaning imputed to them. The shrill cry
uttered through the trunk is indicative of rage, and is generally
given when the animal is rushing upon its adversary.
When the attention of an individual elephant of a herd is attracted
by any unusual object, the intelligence is conveyed
to the others by a low, suppressed sound, uttered by the lips,
and compared by hunters to the word “prut,” or the twittering
of a bird. Major Macready, military secretary of Ceylon,
describes a sound that he heard made by a wild elephant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
as “a sort of a banging noise, like a cooper hammering a
cask,” produced, he believes, by the animal striking its sides
rapidly with its trunk. It may have been made, as has been
previously described, by striking the tip of the trunk against
the ground.</p>

<p>In size the Ceylon elephants average about the same as
the continental animals, about nine feet. Wolf, a chaplain,
who resided in Ceylon many years, states that he saw one
that was taken near Jaffna which was twelve feet in height.
Perhaps this animal was measured by throwing a rope over
its back, and accepting one-half as the height, which would
be at least twelve inches in excess of what it should be.
The herds in Ceylon are generally families, and, as a rule,
greatly resemble each other. The most powerful tusker is
the leader, though a strong-minded female is often implicitly
obeyed. Tennent considers that a herd recognizes the tusker-in-chief
as a leader, and will support him in danger. He
cites an instance where a tusker was wounded, and the rest
of the herd crowded about him, covering his retreat to the
forest. I am inclined to think, however, that the observers
misinterpreted the actions of the herd, and that the
tusker’s presence in the centre was accidental, or the result
of his superior strength.</p>

</div>

<p>That elephants have a method of communication, no one
can doubt. An interesting instance of this was reported to
Sir Emerson Tennent by Major Skinner of the British army,
who spent many years in the jungle, and was a competent
and intelligent observer. He says, “The case you refer to
struck me as exhibiting something more than ordinary brute
instinct, and approached nearer to reasoning powers than
any other instance I can now remember. I cannot do justice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
to the scene; although it appeared to me at the time to
be so remarkable, that it left a deep impression in my mind.
In the dry season in Nenera-Kalawa, you know the streams
are all dried up, and the tanks nearly so. All animals are
then sorely pressed for water; and they congregate in the
vicinity of those tanks, in which there may remain ever so
little of the precious element. During one of these seasons,
I was encamped on the bund, or embankment, of a very small
tank, the water in which was so dried that its surface could
not have exceeded five hundred square yards. It was the
only pond within many miles, and I knew that of necessity a
very large herd of elephants which had been in the neighborhood
all day must resort to it at night. On the lower side
of the tank, and on a line with the embankment, was a thick
forest, in which the elephants sheltered themselves during
the day. On the upper side, and all about the tank, there
was considerable margin of open ground. It was one of
those beautiful, bright, clear, moonlight nights, when objects
could be seen almost as distinctly as by day; and I determined to
avail myself of the opportunity to observe the
movements of the herd, which had already manifested some
uneasiness at our presence. The locality was very favorable
for my purpose, and an enormous tree projecting over the
tank afforded me a secure lodgement in its branches. Having
ordered the fires of my camp to be extinguished at an early
hour, and all my followers to retire to rest, I took up my
post of observation on the overhanging bough; but I had
to remain for upwards of two hours before any thing was to
be seen or heard of the elephants, although I knew they
were within five hundred yards of me. At length, about
the distance of three hundred feet from the water, an immensely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
large elephant issued from the dense cover, and
advanced cautiously across the open ground to within one
hundred yards of the tank, where he stood perfectly motionless.
So quiet had the elephants become, although they had
been roaring, and beating the jungle, throughout the day
and evening, that not a movement was now heard.</p>

<p>“The huge vidette remained in his position still as a rock
for a few moments, and then made three successive stealthy
advances of several yards (halting for some minutes between
each, with ears bent forward to catch the slightest sound);
and, in this way, he moved slowly up to the water’s edge.
Still, he did not venture to quench his thirst; for, though
his fore-feet were partially in the water, he remained for some
minutes, listening in perfect silence. He returned cautiously
and slowly to the position he had at first taken upon emerging
from the forest. Here, in a little while, he was joined
by five others; with them he again proceeded, as cautiously,
but less slowly, to within a few yards of the tank, and then
posted his patrols. He then re-entered the forest, and collected
around him the whole herd, between eighty and one
hundred, led them across the open ground with the most
extraordinary composure and quietness till he joined the
advance-guard, when he left them for a moment, and repeated
his former <i>reconnaissance</i> at the edge of the tank.
Having apparently satisfied himself that all was safe, he
returned, and obviously gave the order to advance; for in
a moment the whole herd rushed into the water with a
degree of unreserved confidence so opposite to the caution
and timidity which had marked their previous movements,
that nothing will ever persuade me that there was not rational
and preconcerted co-operation throughout the whole party,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
and a degree of responsible authority exercised by the
patriarch leader.”</p>

<p>The caution exhibited by the elephants here mentioned is
characteristic of these animals; and so suspicious are they,
that a fence of the simplest kind is often sufficient to prevent
their inroads. Near Anarájapoora, there was formerly
a pond, in which elephants drank; and near by, enclosed in
a very frail fence, was some vegetation growing, especially
attractive to the elephant; yet the latter was a complete
protection to it.</p>

<p>From caution or curiosity, elephants often pull up the
tracing-pegs put down by surveyors; and this has also been
noticed in the continental elephants.</p>

<p>Some of the bravest elephant-hunters are found in Ceylon.
They follow the animal as a profession, and are called panickeas,
and live in the Moorish villages in the northern and
north-eastern part of the island. Their remarkable skill in
following the huge game calls to mind that of the Indians of
our own continent. Frequently two panickeas will chase an
elephant, and capture it single-handed. Their method is to
keep to the leeward of the animal, and creep upon it when
feeding, and fasten a slip-noose about the leg, that is often
lifted, or kept in motion. This accomplished, the elephant
turns, and endeavors to break away; but the rope is secured
to a tree, and the monster is caught. A man now rushes in
front, and shouts the monosyllable, “<i>Dah! dah!</i>” that seems
to have some irritating effect. This attracts attention from
the other man, who now throws a noose about the other leg;
and soon the elephant is completely in the toils. A covering
is then built over it, a camp formed, and the initiatory training
performance commenced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>The animals are generally trained, however, by Arabs, and
go to the rájahs and native princes in India, whose agents
were formerly, and to some extent at present, sent to Ceylon
for the purpose.</p>

<p>So brave are these men, that they seem to have absolutely
no fear of the elephant; and, if the white hunter is known
to them as a good shot, they will go up to an elephant, and
slap him on the leg to make him turn, and present to their
employer a vulnerable spot.</p>

<p>Most of the captured elephants of Ceylon are taken to
Manaar: that is an important elephant depot, from which
they are bought, and shipped to India. Arabs resort here,
buying horses to exchange for elephants, and to trade in them
in many ways.</p>

<p>Elephants have been captured by the herd in Ceylon from
very early times; the process, as late as 1847, differing but
little from that employed in India to-day. The animals were
driven into a corral, and often two thousand men were
employed in the hunt. Formerly the natives were forced to
join in the hunt; but, in later years, they have been only too
willing, as the elephants destroy their crops. The priests
also encourage the hunters, as the elephants devour the
sacred Bo-trees; and they are also desirous of obtaining
the animals for use in the processions of the temples.</p>

<p>In the drive, the men stretch out, and surround the elephants;
and, when they are encompassed, fires are built ten
paces apart, and kept burning all day and night. Gradually
they close in on the victims; and in every direction, except
that of the corral, a fusillade of guns is kept up, accompanied
by shouts, and beating of drums, until finally the terrified
animals rush into the corral, and are caught. When the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
elephants are entrapped, female elephants with riders enter
the corral; and soon the captives are noosed, and tied to
trees. Then commence the struggles that often continue for
hours; the huge beasts assuming the most seemingly impossible
positions,—standing on their heads, twisting their
bodies into various shapes, breaking down trees, and venting
their rage in a variety of ways,—until, utterly wearied,
they lie or stand, and throw dust over their bodies with their
trunks, then insert the latter into their mouths, and withdraw
enough water to convert it into mud.</p>

<p>The wonderful sagacity, if obedience to the mahouts can
be called such, exhibited by the female elephant, is remarkable.
They seem to understand just what is required of
them,—butting over fractious captives, assisting to tie them,
kneeling upon them when they attempt to rise too quickly,
holding their trunks when they are directed to the approaching
noose, and in every way assisting their drivers, and
showing what would generally be considered great intelligence.
“The whole scene,” says Sir Emerson Tennent, “exhibits
the most marvellous example of the voluntary alliance
of animal sagacity and instinct in active co-operations with
human intelligence and courage; and nothing else in nature,
not even the chase of the whale, can afford so vivid an illustration
of the sovereignty of man over the brute creation,
even when confronted with force in its most stupendous
embodiment.”</p>

<p>The process of training the elephants is not so difficult as
is generally supposed. For a few days, or until they eat
freely, they are allowed to rest, a tame elephant being tied
near to re-assure them; and, where a large number are being
educated, wild ones are placed in stalls between half tame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
ones, until they take their food regularly. In the first lesson,
the head stableman, or “Cooroowe vidahm,” takes his place in
front of a wild elephant, bearing a long, sharp, iron-pointed
stick. Two other men station themselves on each side,
assisted by the tame elephants, and hold their crooks toward
the wild elephant’s trunk; while others rub his back soothingly,
chanting such epithets as, “Ho! my son,” or, “Ho!
my father.” This irritates the animal, who immediately
strikes out with his trunk, the men receiving it upon their
weapons; and, in a very short time, the elephant learns not
to strike at a man.</p>

<p>This lesson having been inculcated, number two is begun,
which consists in taking it to bathe between two tame elephants.
The feet are tied as closely as possible, and the
great beast is made to lie down in the water by pressing its
backbone with the crooks. This is extremely painful, and
is met by furious protests; but finally the animals learn to
kneel at the slightest prick of the sharp weapons, and having
once succumbed to the power of man, as shown in a number
of ways, rapidly become domesticated. Kind treatment does
much toward conciliating them; but, like people, each elephant
has its own peculiar disposition.</p>

<p>In two months a wild elephant may be led without a tame
companion; and in three months they are generally put to
work, at first in treading clay in brick-fields, or harnessed to
a wagon with a tame companion, and finally in the lumber-yards,
where all their intelligence is brought to play.</p>

<p>The Ceylon elephants attain an age equal to that of the
Indian animals. Trained elephants have been kept in use
one hundred and forty years; and, according to Tennent, one
employed by Mr. Cripps was represented by the Cooroowe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
people to have served the king of Kandy in the same capacity
sixty years before. Among the papers left by Col.
Robertson, who held a command in Ceylon in 1799, shortly
after the capture of the island by the British, there is a
memorandum showing that a decoy (female) was then attached
to the elephant establishment at Molura, which the
records proved to have served under the Dutch during the
entire period of their occupation (extending to upwards of
one hundred and forty years). It was said to have been
found in the stables by the Dutch on the expulsion of the
Portuguese in 1650.</p>

</div>

<p>The popular opinion concerning the elephant is, that it is
treacherous, quick to avenge an insult, and possesses a
specially retentive memory regarding injuries received. This
is an exaggeration: when compared to other animals, the
elephant excels in its good qualities. Vices are found only
in exceptional cases; the average males being, as a rule, safe,
and not susceptible to sudden changes of temper; while the
females are particularly mild and gentle. Sanderson says,
“Among hundreds that I have known, only two have had
any tricks. One of these would not allow herself to be
ridden by a strange mahout, and the other had a great aversion
to any natives but her own two attendants approaching
her.”</p>

<p>In the management of these animals, strict discipline always
has to be maintained. Mr. P. T. Barnum tells me,
that while his herd of twenty or more are treated with the
greatest kindness, yet fear is the secret of their obedience.
The keeper never relaxes his power over them; and, if not
in sight, the steel hook and pointer of their trainer, though,
perhaps, concealed, is always at hand, and ready for use.
Even the most gentle elephants, particularly the males, are
liable in confinement to outbursts of fury; becoming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
ungovernable, and doing great damage before they can be
subdued or killed.</p>

<p>Without warning, an elephant, which for years had been
a quiet and docile member of the East Indian commissariat
stud, became possessed of a veritable demon, broke loose, and
fled trumpeting to the woods. For many weeks, it was a
constant terror to the entire country in the vicinity;—rushing
into villages, destroying houses; and, before it was killed,
thirty-five human beings fell victims to its fury.</p>

<p>Such instances are comparatively rare; and it should be
said to the credit of the elephant, that while it is really the
king of beasts, and capable of greater destruction than any
in India, it has less casualties laid to its door than any so-called
dangerous animal. The following table indicates this
more plainly, and shows the number of persons and domestic
animals destroyed by wild mammals in India during the
year 1875, the numbers being about the same every year:—</p>

<p>The Philadelphia elephant Dom, who was named in honor
of Dom Pedro of Brazil, occasionally gave way to fits of
rage, became unmanageable; and people flocked to the garden
to see it disciplined. This consisted of securing each foot at
a time, and hauling them apart by strong tackles, so that the
huge beast was utterly powerless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>Travelling around the country seems to irritate elephants,
and reports are often seen of their outbursts of rage. The
famous Chief, owned by Robinson, became enraged at Charlotte,
N.C., a few years ago, and, without the slightest warning,
killed its keeper. The latter was attempting to illustrate
to the audience how the elephant climbed into the special car
provided for it, when the animal lost its patience, and hurled
the unfortunate man against the car with terrific force, killing
him before the very eyes of the people.</p>

<p>Tom, the pet elephant of the Duke of Edinburgh, who was
brought from India in 1870 in H. R. H’s yacht, “Galatea,”
killed its keeper in very much the same way.</p>

<p>The greatest elephant panic ever seen in this country was
that created by Barnum’s Emperor, who suddenly developed
all the characteristics of a rogue, while the circus was exhibiting
in Troy, N.Y. The trouble commenced when an
attempt was made to drive Emperor and Jumbo to the train.
The former had decided objections to continuing the tour;
and he suddenly bolted, and shuffled furiously up the street
in the direction of the iron-foundery of Erastus Corning.
The large door being open, the excited animal rushed in, and
in a moment was trampling upon the red-hot coal and metal,
uttering fierce shrieks. And now utterly enraged and mad,
he rushed from the building into the crowded streets, trampling
upon men, hurling others down an embankment with his
trunk, breaking one man’s leg in his flight, throwing another
twenty feet into the air, while a woman was taken from
the stoop of a house and hurled into the street. In fact, the
demon of rage seemed to possess the huge creature, that ran
amuck until he had destroyed four thousand dollars’ worth
of property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>Another rogue elephant was Romeo, owned by the Forepaugh
Company, who died in Chicago in 1872, having killed
three men, and destroyed property valued at fifty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>Almost equally vicious was Mr. Barnum’s Albert. This
elephant killed its keeper at Keene, N.H.; and, after being
loaded with chains, it was led out into the woods, followed
by a large crowd, and a company of Keene riflemen. Its
trainer, Arstinstall, marked the location of the heart upon
the dark hide of the unsuspecting giant; and at the word,
the great animal fell.</p>

<p>These fits of frenzy are sometimes periodic, and the elephant
is then said to be <i>must</i>, or mad. The paroxysms vary
in different animals. Some are lethargic, or sleepy; while
others go mad, and endeavor to wreak vengeance upon
any thing within reach. In the chapter on the anatomy of
the elephant, reference is made to a pore in the temple of the
animal; and, when expert elephant-men see an oily liquid
exuding from this orifice, they accept it as a warning that
the period of <i>must</i> is approaching; the elephant is immediately
shackled, and keepers and strangers are warned to keep
out of reach.</p>

<p>After this secretion has flowed for a while, the temples
swell, and the animal is avoided by every one; its food being
tossed at it, or pushed toward it on the end of a pole. If,
during this time, the elephant escapes, destruction of human
life is almost sure to follow. They attack every living creature,
including their own kind. Sanderson says, “I once
saw one of our tuskers, which was then only under suspicion
of an approaching fit, break away from the control of his
mahout, as he was being ridden to water, and, despite severe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
punishment, attack, knock down, another elephant near by;
and, had his tusks not been cut, he would, without doubt,
have killed her on the spot. He was at last driven off by
spears thrown at his trunk and head. Then he stalked
across the open plain with his mahout on his neck, fury in
his eye, master of all he surveyed, and evidently courting
battle from any created being. The men had a difficult and
dangerous task to secure him. His hind-legs were at last
tied from behind the trunk of a tree, near which he stood;
and the mahout having drawn up a chain by a cord, and
secured it around his neck, he was moored fore and aft. I
shall never forget the mahout’s fervent ejaculation of
‘Allah! Allah!’ as he slipped over the elephant’s tail when
he was made fast.” According to Mr. Sanderson, the flow
of <i>must</i> is observed in both male and female elephants, but
never in the tame females.</p>

<p>Besides the elephants which are supposed to have bad
tempers, and occasionally exhibit them, there are certain
animals which are by nature ugly, and more or less untrustworthy.
These are called rogues, and by some, from their
seeming love of a solitary life, “solitaries.” The rogue elephants,
or solitaries, are popularly supposed to be soured individuals,
who have been driven from a herd by rivals or
companions; but this is a mistake, as investigation has
shown that supposed solitaries were often old tuskers grazing
some distance from a herd.</p>

<p>Certain elephants undoubtedly prefer a solitary life: but
the so-called solitar is generally a young male who has not
been able to assert his position in the herd, and is grazing
along the outskirts; or is an old and bold tusker, who
wanders about careless of its safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>All seemingly isolated elephants are looked upon with
suspicion, as, when met, they often rush to the attack, and
prove dangerous enemies. The real rogue is usually a
vicious tusker, such as <i>Mandla</i>, an elephant that was owned
near Jubbulpore, Central Provinces. This brute was supposed
to be mad, and, in 1875, suddenly developed a taste for
human victims,—rushing at them at sight, attacking houses,
or any object that excited its ire, and ultimately killing a
large number of persons. This monster not only killed its
victims, but is said to have eaten them, tearing the bodies
limb from limb, and was known before its death as the man-eater.
This is probably an exaggeration; the fact being, that
the elephant took the victim in its mouth while it tore him
in pieces, the demoralized natives thinking that it was eating
him. An organized hunt was made for this elephant, and it
was finally killed by two English officers.</p>

<p>A few years ago elephants in various parts of India, especially
about Morlay, became so fearless, that they entered
fields adjoining the towns, and did great damage; some,
showing the disposition of the typical rogue, could hardly
be driven away. In one case in India, a number of Oopligas
drove a herd into the hills with their horns and tomtoms; and,
a heavy rain coming on, they thought it hardly necessary to
keep up the guard, so retired from the field. In the morning,
they found that a valuable lot of the Indian maize
(<i>Sorghum vulgare</i>) had been destroyed, the entire herd returning
as soon as the noise had ceased. Mr. Sanderson
caught this entire herd in 1874.</p>

<p>About thirty years before the man-eating elephant was
heard of, a male rogue elephant created great devastation in
the fields of the Morlayites. It was continually breaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
into their rice; but one morning, being seen near a village,
the entire population turned out, and with hue and cry gave
chase. The rogue, who was also a coward, dashed away,
rushing blindly into a marsh, or morass, and soon sank to its
knees in soft mud, and was almost completely at the mercy
of the pursuers. They surrounded it, and rained stones and
other missiles upon it; and finally, one native, more revengeful
and cruel than the others, threw some lighted straw upon
the poor creature’s back. The terrible wounds seemed to
spur it to greater exertions; and it finally escaped, and
ultimately recovered, being often seen and recognized by its
scars.</p>

<p>Sanderson mentions two tuskers which travelled about
together, “twin solitaries.” They were extremely vicious,
had killed people, and were finally proscribed by the government.
One of the tuskers was killed by Mr. Sanderson in
1870. Referring to rogue elephants which he had observed, he
says, “I had just finished dinner, and was enjoying a smoke
before a blazing camp-fire, which lit to their topmost branches
a pair of magnificent tamarind-trees, under which my tent
was pitched, when I heard a distant shout of ‘Ánay!’ (elephants).
At once, lights began to flit over the plain, moving
towards one point; tomtoms were beaten, and rattles made
from split bamboo sounded. An elephant trumpeted shrilly,
the men yelled in defiance, till the intruders retreated to the
jungle. The cover bordering on cultivation was so dense as
to afford secure shelter to elephants close at hand, even
during the day. After some little time, when the tomtomming
and noise had ceased, a similar commotion took place at
another point: again the Will-o’-the-wisp lights moved forward,
with a repetition of the shouting and trumpeting.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
The villagers who were keeping up my camp-fire told me
that it was only on occasional nights that the elephants
visited cultivation. The watchers were evidently in for it
now, and they became thoroughly alert at all points.</p>

<p>“Once the elephants came within two hundred yards of
my camp; and, long after I went to bed, I heard the shouting
and rattling of the watchers. These men were the Strolagas
from the hills: they were hired annually for a month or two,
at a fixed payment in grain, for watching their crops, by the
low-country cultivators, who are themselves less able to
stand the exposure on a rice-flat, and less bold in interfering
with elephants. The watchers provide themselves with
torches of light split bamboos in bundles, about eight feet
long, and eight inches in diameter. These are lighted at one
end, when required, and make a famous blaze. Armed with
them, the men sally forth to the spot where the elephants are
feeding. Some carry the torches; the others precede them,
so as to have the light behind them. The elephants can be
seen on open ground one hundred yards, should they wait to
let the lights get so close. Some troublesome rogues get
beyond caring for this; though the men are very bold, and
approach within forty or fifty yards. Natives have often
told me of particular elephants letting them get within a few
yards, and then putting their trunks into their mouths, and
withdrawing water, squirting it at the lights. I hardly need
say that the latter part of the statement is purely imaginary;
the idea doubtless arising from the attitude elephants often
assume when in uncertainty or perplexity, putting the trunk
into the mouth, and holding the tip gently between the lips.”</p>

<p>The large area of rice-fields on the bed of the Honganoor
Lake was assessed long ago at one-third the usual rates, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
account of the depredations of elephants. Mr. Sanderson
adds, however, that the actual damage done to crops by elephants
is much less than popularly supposed.</p>

<p>In capturing wild elephants, numbers of tuskers which have
escaped, often follow the herd, and wander about the camps
at night. On one occasion, a large female charged a tame
elephant and rider. The latter was warned by a native, and
slipped around his elephant’s neck just in time to save his
life; but the jaws of the old rogue struck his thigh, and she
endeavored to crush him with her single tusk. He drove his
goad into her mouth, when she drew off, and came on again
at full speed. The rider again dodged over his elephant’s
neck, and a second time the single tusk struck his leg.
This was repeated several times; and the rider, whose elephant
was in the midst of a herd of wild ones in a corral,
was in despair, when one of his assistants hurled a spear,
striking the rogue in the head. A moment later, the latter’s
elephant struck her a terrific blow, head on, almost knocking
her over, and completely turning the scales.</p>

<p>Tame tuskers, under the direction of a mahout, soon outwit
wild elephants in a battle. Females rarely fight among
themselves; but, when they do, their spite is vented upon
one another in a ludicrous and aggravating manner, by biting
off each other’s tails.</p>

<p>Sanderson had a singular adventure with a rogue elephant
who attempted to enter his tent at night. He started to his
feet, first seeing his tent rip, and, on looking out, discovered
that a wild elephant was tearing it with its tusks. The
next day, it was found torn in two, with two tusk-holes in it.
The next night a guard of men and a tame elephant was
established; but at midnight, he was awakened by feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
the tent shake. Leaping to his feet, he looked out, saw the
men asleep, and the tame elephant some distance off. While
he stood, there came a crash, and the small tent fell in;
when he found that probably the same elephant was investigating
again; but, before he could clear himself from the
canvas, it had made off, startled by the noise. The attack
was probably made out of mere curiosity, or, perhaps, in a
spirit of mischief. They have been known to trample down
embankments, overturn telegraph-poles, haul up surveying-pins;
and once, when a surveying-party left their chain overnight
in a jungle, it could be heard jingling occasionally, the
elephants evidently being pleased with the sound it made.</p>

<p>A famous rogue elephant for months devastated the country
about Kákankoté. It first destroyed the crops; and
gradually becoming bolder and bolder, it finally actually
took possession of a strip of the country about eight miles
long, including a part of the main road between Mysore and
the Wynaad. No one dared to travel in the road; the monster
charging every one, finally killing two natives. This
aroused the populace; and the amildár, or native official, appealed
to the government elephant-keeper for protection. A
few days later, he was on the ground, and, with a party of
Kurrabas trackers, was ready to slay the rogue. So great
was the alarm, that the hunter found native policemen at the
entrance of the jungle, to warn travellers of the elephant;
and all who went through were preceded by natives, who,
with tomtoms and other instruments, endeavored to frighten
the brute, who was well known to every one by his large
size, black color, and peculiar, up-curved, short tusks. For
several days the professional hunter followed the great animal,
and came up with him; but, by an unfortunate stampede,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
he lost him, and the hunt had to be given up for the
time. Five months later it was renewed: and, after a long
chase, the rogue was found in a bamboo thicket; then, after
waiting for a fair shot, the hunter tired a heavy bullet,
putting it just behind the shoulder.</p>

<p>For a second, there was a deathly silence, then, with a terrific
scream, the monster dashed away; and the men, in full
pursuit, were soon covered with blood that flowed from the
wounds. The rogue ran for two hundred yards, and, when
the Kurrabas came upon him, presented a terrible appearance.
He was facing his foes, his trunk doubled, head elevated,
and blood rushing from his mouth; yet the animal’s
eyes were gleaming with fury, and it was ready to sell its life
dearly. The hunter fired with a four-bore rifle; the bullet
penetrating the brain, and killing him upon the spot. As
the huge creature rolled over, the men crawled upon its
upper side, which was six feet from the grass. The head and
feet were taken; the former being placed on the main road
for some time, to inform the natives that the end of the
rogue had come.</p>

<p>The tusks of this elephant were small, being ten inches in
circumference at the gum, and weighed twenty-two and a
half pounds, curving up in a curious way.</p>

<p>Capt. Dunlop, of the British army, refers to a rogue elephant
in the Doon, named Gunesh. It was the property of
the government, but escaped, and for years caused a reign
of terror in the country. It had a chain upon its leg, and
the clank of this in the jungle near a village demoralized the
entire populace. For fifteen years this brute wandered about,
destroying rice-fields; and, during that time, it killed over
fifteen persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>Another rogue followed a courier of the English postal
service, and trampled him to death.</p>

<p>While the canal of Beejapore was being made, a rogue
elephant charged upon the men from some bushes, and seized
one; then, pressing the body under its ponderous feet, the
fiend deliberately pulled away the upper portion of it, and
with a remnant in its trunk ran back into the bush.</p>

<p>Some woodmen engaged in cutting trees in the jungle
about Chandnee-Doon, had an almost identical experience.
One day three of them remained at home; while, during the
day, one of the men went to a neighboring spring to draw
some water. As he did not return, one of his companions
went after him; and that evening they were both found
dead, their bones being crushed and broken. The rogue
had seized and thrown them to the ground, crushing them
by a tread of its ponderous foot.</p>

<p>In Ceylon, the rogue is called a <i>hora</i>, or <i>ronkedor</i>; the
Singhalese, according to Tennent, believing it to be an individual
that has either lost its associates by accident, and,
from its solitary life, become morose and savage; or a naturally
vicious individual, that, being more daring, has separated
itself from its companions. Whatever may be the
reason for the savage temper exhibited by these solitary
brutes, they constitute a characteristic of elephant life, and,
in Ceylon, seem to possess the same likes and dislikes that
mark the African and Asiatic rogues.</p>

<p>More daring than the peacefully disposed elephants, they
come out of the jungle at night, and prowl around the towns
and villages, trampling down cultivated tracts, devouring the
standing rice and young cocoa-palms, becoming so bold in
some places, that one has been known to enter a field, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
seize a sheaf from a pile in the very midst of a party of
workers, who fled in terror. As a rule, however, they remain
concealed by day, committing their depredations by night.
In some sections, as the low country of Badulla, the villagers
build moats or ditches about their huts to protect themselves
from the rogues.</p>

<p>Certain localities seem to be infested by these creatures.
Thus, in 1847, a dangerous rogue frequented the Rangbodde
Pass on a mountain road, that led to the Sanitarium at
Neuera-ellia, and demoralized the entire country so that
people were afraid to undertake the pass unless in numbers.
Its method of attack was to seize natives, as it did a Caffre
of the Caffre Corps of pioneers, with its trunk, and beat the
victim to death against the bank.</p>

<p>Some years ago a native trader and party were travelling
near Idalgasinna, when they suddenly heard the shrill trumpeting
of a rogue. The entire company took to their heels;
the coolies casting away their goods, and making for the
jungle. The trader himself hid behind a large rock, and saw
the elephant seize one of the coolies, and, after carrying him
a short distance, dash him to the ground, and trample upon
him; then turning to the goods they carried, he tore them in
pieces, after which he walked into the jungle. This elephant
was a noted rogue, and in its time destroyed the lives
of a number of people. He was finally killed by an English
sportsman.</p>

<p>A native made a statement to a Singhalese gentleman,
who in turn imparted the information to Sir Emerson Tennent,
that once, when he was on his way to Badulla, and
walking around a hill, a large elephant rushed upon his
party without warning, trumpeting loudly. In a moment, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
had seized the native’s companion, who, it happened, was in
the rear, and killed him by hurling him to the ground.
Dropping the first victim, he then seized the narrator of the
incident, and hurled him aloft with such force that he landed
in the branches of a cahata-tree, and lodged there, thus escaping
with only a dislocation of the wrist. The elephant
returned to the body upon the ground, and tore it limb from
limb, mutilating it as much as possible.</p>

<p>Rogue elephants in Ceylon are often very mischievous.
In some sections, the tracing-pegs that have been put down
by surveyors during one day, are pulled up the next by elephants.
Rogues, like other elephants, are very suspicious.
Col. Hardy, at one time deputy quartermaster-general in
Ceylon, was travelling to an outpost in the south-eastern portion
of the island, and one day became lost, and was attacked
at dusk by a rogue. He ran for cover, but was almost
caught, when he happened to think of his dressing-case; and,
throwing it down, his pursuer came to an immediate stand-still,
stopping to examine it carefully, while the officer
escaped.</p>

<p>Other rogues destroy every thing they can find. In “The
Colombo Observer” of March, 1858, there was a reward
of twenty-five guineas offered for the destruction of an
elephant that had taken up its residence in the Rajawallé
coffee-plantation near Kandy. The huge animal terrified the
people for miles about; its plan being, to come out of the jungle
at night, and pull down buildings and trees on the plantation.
It seemed to have an especial spite for the pipes of
the water-works, the pillars of which it tore down; while the
tops were all destroyed by this curious animal, who was
finally shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>Some years ago a rogue elephant was wounded near the
town of Hambangtotte by a native, and followed the latter
into the town in a wild race, catching him in the bazaar in
the midst of the town, and trampling him to death before a
crowd of people, then making good its escape.</p>

<p>Often tame elephants, excited by some means, become
rogues for the time. During one of the attempts by the
government to capture an entire herd in Ceylon, a fine tame
tusker became intensely excited, and finally, in a frenzy of
rage, broke down the bars of the corral with its head and
tusks, and ran into the jungle. A few days later, its driver
went after it with a decoy; when it approached, he courageously
leaped upon the back of the maddened beast, and
with a pair of hooks subdued it, until it was firmly chained,
when it allowed itself to be led away.</p>

<p>That elephants do not easily forget, is shown in case of
one that turned rogue, and escaped to the jungle, and, when
recaptured ten years later, immediately obeyed the mahout’s
command to kneel.</p>

<p>That rogue elephants are sometimes the result of inhuman
treatment, is shown in a terrible catastrophe, reported
by an Indian correspondent of “The Pall Mall Gazette” as
occurring in April of the present year, in which seventeen
human beings lost their lives, and much valuable property
was destroyed.</p>

<p>“While an elephant was being ridden by its keeper in the
District of Sultanpore, in Oude, the animal resented ‘prodding’
with a spear, by pulling the man from his back, and
throwing him some distance away. Fortunately the man
fell in a hollow, and remained there undiscovered by the
elephant, who went to a neighboring village. There he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
chased an old man into a house, then broke down the walls,
pulled the man out, and dashed him to pieces. The same
night the elephant knocked down several houses in quest
of human beings, in the villages of Sardapur, Bargaon, and
Jaisingpur. He killed six men in Bersoma, three in Sota,
four in Gaugeo, and four in Mardan. He likewise killed a
bullock and a pony, and also completely destroyed a new
carriage. The animal used to stand at the door of a house,
force his entry by demolishing the walls on either side, and
would then kill as many of the inmates as he could, pursuing
others who tried to run away. He mangled the corpses
terribly. After securing a victim, he sometimes returned to
the spot to see if life were extinct, and would commence
mutilating the body afresh. He carried several bodies long
distances, and threw them into ravines, etc. The elephant
found his way to the Dehra Rájah’s palace, where he tried
to enter the house of a gardener; but some men mounted on
three elephants, assisted by spearmen, drove him off. He
then returned to Bebipur, where he tried to break down his
master’s house, in which several persons had taken refuge.
The police got into the house from a back window, and were
obliged to send for help to the Dehra Rájah, who sent three
elephants and some spearmen. The animal received two
gun-shots on the head at Bebipur, which, however, only
temporarily drove him off. He was ultimately captured at imminent
risk, by the rájah’s three elephants and men.”</p>

<span class="smaller">HUNTING THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>From the huge size of its body and tusks, the African
elephant affords, if any thing, a better opportunity of
testing the skill and endurance of the hunter than its Asiatic
ally. In former years, the great game was found from the
Southern limit of Sahara to Cape Town; but so insatiate has
been the greed for ivory, that it has been gradually driven
from the more exposed tracts, and is now confined to the
most unfrequented parts of the great continent; and as it
is only with great difficulty and incalculable hardship that
it can be followed, the animal is rarely hunted at the present
day for pure sport, the ivory tusks alone being the desideratum.
As about one hundred thousand elephants are killed
every year, and they are slow breeders, their utter extermination
seems only a matter of time. If the present
depletion of the numbers of the African species continues,
it will be but a memory of the past in a comparatively
few years.</p>

<p>The African elephant is followed in several ways. Some
hunters, as Baldwin, prefer to depend upon horses, and, so
mounted, follow the herd at full speed, leaping from the
saddle, firing quickly, and avoiding the charge by the fleetness
of the horse. Others, as Selous, prefer shooting on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
foot. The latter met with an extraordinary adventure while
following a fine elephant, and narrowly escaped. The following
is his account:—</p>

<p>“My horse was now so tired that he stood well; so, reining
in, I gave her a shot from his back between the neck and the
shoulder, which I believe just stopped her from charging.
On receiving this wound, she backed a few paces, gave her
ears a flap against her sides, and then stood facing me again.
I had just taken out the empty cartridge, and was about to
put a fresh one in, when, seeing that she looked very vicious,
and as I was not thirty yards from her, I caught the bridle,
and turned the horse’s head away, so as to be ready for a fair
start in case of a charge. I was still holding my rifle with
the breech open, when I saw that she was coming. Digging
the spurs into my horse’s ribs, I did my best to get him
away; but he was so thoroughly done, that instead of springing
forwards, which was what the emergency required, he
only started at a walk, and was just breaking into a canter
when the elephant was upon us. I heard two short, sharp
screams above my head, and had just time to think it was all
over with me, when, horse and all, I was dashed to the
ground. For a few seconds I was half stunned by the violence
of the shock; and the first thing I became aware of,
was a very strong smell of elephant. At the same instant, I
felt that I was still unhurt, and that, though in an unpleasant
predicament, I had still a chance for life. I was, however,
pressed down on the ground in such a way that I could not
extricate my head. At last, with a violent effort I wrenched
myself loose, and threw my body over sideways, so that I
rested on my hands. As I did so, I saw the hind-legs of the
elephant standing like two pillars before me, and at once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
grasped the situation. She was on her knees, with her head
and tusks in the ground; and I had been pressed down
under her chest, but luckily behind her fore-legs. Dragging
myself from under her, I regained my feet, and made a hasty
retreat, having had rather more than enough of elephants for
the time being. I retained, however, sufficient presence of
mind to run slowly, watching her movements over my
shoulder, and directing mine accordingly. Almost immediately
I had made my escape, she got up, and stood looking
for me with her ears up and head raised, turning first to one
side, and then to the other, but never wheeling quite round.
As she made these turns, I ran obliquely to the right or left,
as the case might be, always endeavoring to keep her stern
towards me. At length I gained the shelter of a small bush,
and breathed freely once more.</p>

<p>“All this time I never saw my horse, which must have
been lying amongst the grass where he had been thrown to
the ground. I thought he was dead; or perhaps, to speak
more truly, I was so engrossed with my own affairs that I
did not think about him at all. I stood now just on the
highest ground of a gentle rise, which sloped gradually down
to an open glade, in which, from where I was, I could see
two dead elephants. Just then I saw a Caffre coming across
the opening, and went down to meet him, leaving my elephant
still standing on the spot where she had knocked me
down. Being unarmed,—for my gun had been dashed from
my hand when I fell,—I dared not go near her to look for it.
Upon meeting the Caffre, I hastily told him what had happened.
The elephant was not now visible, being just beyond
the crest of the rise, about two hundred yards distant; but
I only stopped to take some cartridges from my trousers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
pocket, and put them in my belt, and then, accompanied by
the boy, returned to the scene of the accident to look for my
rifle, and see what had become of my horse. On topping
the rise, we saw him standing without the saddle; but the
elephant had walked away, and was no longer visible. Going
up to my horse, I found that he had received an ugly wound
in the buttock from behind, from which the blood was streaming
down the leg: otherwise, barring a few abrasions, he was
unhurt. Whilst the boy was searching for my rifle, I looked
round for the elephant, which I knew had only just moved
away, and, seeing a cow standing amongst some bushes not
two hundred yards from me, made sure it was the one that
had so nearly made an example of me. The Caffre now came
up with my rifle and saddle, the girth of which was broken.
The rifle, having been open at the breech when it fell to the
ground, was full of sand; so that it was not until I had taken
the lever out, using the point of the Caffre’s assegai for a
screw-driver, that I managed to get it to work. I then approached
the elephant, which all the time had been standing
where I first saw her, and, cautiously advancing to within
fifty yards of her, took a careful aim, and gave her a shot
behind the shoulder, which brought her to the ground with a
crash. Pushing in another cartridge, I ran up, and gave her
a shot in the back of the head to make sure of her.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hunters do not always escape so fortunately as did Mr.
Selous. One of the native hunters employed by him, named
Quabeet, followed a bull elephant into the bush, and was
never seen alive again. The brute must have laid in wait
for him, and rushed out, taking him unawares. The bushes
around the locality were levelled to the ground; and, when
finally the body was discovered, it was torn in three pieces.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
“The chest, with head and arms attached, which had been
wrenched from the trunk just below the breast-bone, lying in
one place; one leg and thigh, that had been torn off at the
pelvis, in another; and the remainder in a third. The right
arm had been broken in two places, and the hand crushed;
one of the thighs was also broken; but otherwise the fragment
had not been trampled on. There is little reason to
doubt,” continues Selous, “that the infuriated elephant must
have pressed the unfortunate man down with his foot or
knee, and then, twisting his trunk round his body, wrenched
him asunder. This feat gives one an idea of the awful
strength of these huge beasts, and how powerless the strongest
of men.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the elephant is attacked with javelins, or spears,
and so killed. Dr. Livingstone thus describes an instance
that he witnessed:—</p>

<p>“I had retired from the noise, to take observations among
some rocks of laminated grit, when I beheld an elephant
and her calf at the end of a valley, about two miles distant.
The calf was rolling in the mud, and the dam was fanning
herself with her great ears. As I looked at them through
my glass, I saw a long string of my own men approaching
on the other side of them. I then went higher up the side
of the valley, in order to have a distinct view of their mode
of hunting. The goodly beast, totally unconscious of the
approach of an enemy, stood for some time suckling her
young one, which seemed about two years old: then they
went into a pit containing mud, and smeared themselves all
over with it; the little one frisking about his dam, flapping
his ears, and tossing his trunk incessantly in elephantine
fashion. She kept flapping her ears, and wagging her tail, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
if in the height of enjoyment. Then began the piping of
her enemies, which was performed by blowing into a tube,
or the hands closed together, as boys do into a key. They
called out, to attract the animal’s attention,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘O chief, chief! we have come to kill you:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O chief, chief! many others will die beside you;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gods have said it,’ etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Both animals expanded their ears, and listened, then left their
bath. As the crowd rushed towards them, the little one ran
forward to the end of the valley, but, seeing the men, returned
to his dam. She placed herself on the dangerous side of her
calf, and passed her proboscis over it again and again, as if
to assure it of safety. She frequently looked back to the
men, who kept up an incessant shouting, singing, and piping;
then looked at her young one, and ran after it, sometimes
sidewise, as if her feelings were divided between anxiety
to protect her offspring, and desire to revenge the temerity
of her persecutors. The men kept about a hundred yards
in her rear, and some that distance from her flanks, and
continued thus until she was obliged to cross a rivulet.</p>

<p>“The time spent in descending and getting up the opposite
bank allowed of their coming up to the edge and discharging
their spears at about sixty feet distance. After the first discharge,
she appeared with her sides red with blood, and, beginning
to flee for her own life, seemed to think no more of her
young. I had previously sent off Sekweba with orders to
spare the calf. He ran very fast, but neither young nor old
ever enter into a gallop: their quickest pace is only a sharp
walk. Before Sekweba could reach them, the calf had taken
refuge in the water, and was killed. The pace of the dam<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
gradually became slower: she turned with a shriek of rage,
and made a furious charge back among the men. They vanished
at right and left angles from her course; and, as she ran
right on, she went through the whole party, but came near no
one, except a man who wore a piece of cloth on his shoulders.
She charged three or four times, and, except in the first instance,
never went farther than one hundred yards. She
often stood, after she had crossed a rivulet, and faced the
men, though she received fresh spears. It was by this
process of spearing, and loss of blood, that she was killed;
for at last, making a short struggle, she staggered round,
and sank down dead, in a kneeling position.”</p>

<p>While this method is certainly a fair one,—the natives exposing
themselves, and meeting the elephant in the open field,—it
seems a murderous operation to torture such a noble
animal, especially when she is defending her young.</p>

<p>Among the narrow escapes of elephant-hunters in Africa
may be mentioned Mr. Oswold. He was fleeing from an
elephant, near the shores of the Zonga, when his horse stumbled,
and he fell in a thicket, face to the huge brute who was
coming like an avalanche—a veritable mountain of flesh.
He gave himself up as lost; but, by a miracle, the animal
passed within a few inches, missing him in its blind rage.</p>

<p>Elephants are remarkable for their scent, and hunters
always try to keep to the leeward. Charles Volk, a Dutchman,
while hunting, concealed himself in the brush, hoping
to take an elephant unawares. But he was in the wrong
direction: the great game scented him, and a moment later
was upon the unfortunate hunter, and had crushed him into
a shapeless mass. On another occasion, a party came upon
two large elephants in an open spot. They immediately made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
for cover, the hunters wounding a female as she ran. Hoping
to cut off her retreat, they put spurs to their horses, and were
well upon her, when the male, a large tusker, charged upon
them from a thicket. Some of the men had dismounted to
fire; and, though taken by surprise, they succeeded in reaching
their horses, with the exception of a young man, who was
standing with his arm through the bridle, and loading his gun.
The infuriated animal caught him before he could move,
drove both his tusks through his body, and tossed him dead
and bleeding a great height into the air; then, returning to
its mate, both animals made off.</p>

<p>Karol Kreiger’s name is often mentioned by the Dutch
African colonists as a bold hunter, who killed many elephants
in his day, and was extremely fortunate in avoiding their
rushes. He finally met his death while engaged in the sport
of his choice. He was following a wounded elephant, when
the latter suddenly whirled about as if on a pivot, took him
in its trunk, and tossed him like a ball into the air, and, when
he fell, trampled him underfoot in a frenzy of rage. When
the body was recovered, it was completely torn in pieces.</p>

<p>While Europeans are remarkably courageous in facing a
charging elephant, they are exceeded in daring by the Hamran
Arabs, who, without any of the appliances of a modern
sportsman, face the largest and most ferocious elephants
with a simple sword and shield. The Hamran Arabs are
skilled horsemen, and are distinguished from their countrymen
of other tribes by the length of their hair, which is worn
in long curls, and parted in the centre. Their sole method
of defence and attack is the sword and shield. The latter
is of two kinds: one is circular in shape, either of rhinoceros
or giraffe hide, stiffened by a stout piece of wood that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
passes down the centre. The shield is about two feet in
diameter, and resembles, according to Baker, a broad hat
with a low crown terminating in a point. In the crown,
there is a bar of leather used as a grip; while the outside
is protected by a piece of scaly crocodile-hide. The swords,
which are manufactured at Sollingen, are all of one pattern,
being longer or shorter according to the strength of the
owner. The blade is long and straight and two-edged; the
guard being a simple bar, or cross, a fashion presumably
adopted after the Crusades. Some of the wealthy Arabs
decorate the handles with silver; and a good sword is highly
prized, and handed down from generation to generation.
Metal scabbards are not used; the case being two thin strips
of an elastic, soft wood covered with leather, all of which is
to preserve the edge; for this double-edged weapon is so delicate
and keen, that it will cut a hair, and could be used as
a razor. On the march, the sword is looked after with the
greatest care, and is slung from the pommel of the saddle,
passing beneath the thigh. When the Arab dismounts, he
invariably draws it, and, after examining both edges, strops
it upon his shield, and, having shaved a hair from his arm,
returns it to the scabbard.</p>

<p>The swords are about three feet five inches in length; and
about nine inches of the blade is bound with cord, which is
grasped with the right hand, the left seizing the handle, so
that it becomes a two-handed weapon. Thus armed, four
aggageers, as the professional elephant-hunters are called, are
ready to attack the largest elephant. Their method is, if
they have no horses, to follow the great game on foot, and
endeavor, between the hours of ten <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and twelve <span class="allsmcap">M.</span>, to find
one sleeping. If this can be accomplished, they steal upon it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
and with one blow of the terrible sword sever the trunk, producing
a wound from which the elephant will die in an hour.
A well-equipped party, however, consists of four aggageers
on horseback. When the trail of a herd is struck, they dash
in pursuit; and when the animals are discovered, endeavor
to single out the largest tusker, generally an old bull. Galloping
after the fleeing elephant, they soon gain on it, and
endeavor to make it turn and charge,—a matter of little
difficulty. The men now have each a duty to perform. One
places himself immediately in front of the animal, and tries
to attract its attention, as does the matador in the bull-fight.
This is a most dangerous position; as, if the horse stumbles
before the desperate charges of the enraged animal, both
horse and rider will be crushed to death. But, while the
nimble aggageer in front is tantalizing the great beast,
the others are watching their opportunity. Galloping up
behind the fleeing animal until within a foot or so of its
heels, one springs to the ground lightly, sword in hand,
though at full speed, and, racing along on foot for a few seconds,
strikes the elephant a terrific blow, severing the back
sinew of the foot, so that the first pressure after the stroke
dislocates the joint. As the hunter leaps to the ground,
his companion seizes his horse, and, as soon as the blow is
made, he remounts: two or three ride near the unfortunate
elephant’s trunk, to give the third aggageer an opportunity
to sever the sinew of the other hind-foot, which is soon
done; and the huge animal, thus helpless, is literally killed
by two blows of a sword.</p>

<p>The force of the blow given in this way can be imagined
when it is known that a native has been seen to sever the
spine of a wild boar at a single stroke. The aggageers often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
meet with terrible accidents. One employed by Sir S. W.
Baker had his leg almost severed by his own sword. Another
Arab, Roder Sherrif, had had his horse killed from under him
by an elephant, whose tusk at the same time entered his
arm, rendering it useless for life. Yet this maimed man was
considered the finest hunter, and always chose the most
dangerous post, running ahead of the elephant’s trunk to
attract its attention; and it was in doing this that he had
met with the terrible wounds.</p>

<p>The wonderful daring of these hunters, of whom Sir S. W.
Baker said that he felt like taking off his hat to, is well shown
in the following account given by that well-known hunter
and explorer:—</p>

<p>“Having the wind fair, we advanced quickly for about
half the distance, at which time we were within a hundred
and fifty yards of the elephant, which had just arrived at
the water, and had commenced drinking. We now crept
cautiously towards him. The sand-bank had decreased to
a height of about two feet, and afforded very little shelter.
Not a tree nor bush grew upon the surface of the barren
sand, which was so deep that we sank nearly to the ankles
at every footstep. Still we crept forward, as the elephant
alternately drank, and then spouted the water in a shower
over his colossal form; but, just as we had arrived within
about fifty yards, he happened to turn his head in our
direction, and immediately perceived us. He cocked his
enormous ears, gave a short trumpet, and for an instant
he wavered in his determination whether to attack or fly;
but, as I rushed towards him with a shout, he turned towards
the jungle, and I immediately fired a steady shot at the
shoulder with the ‘Baby.’ As usual, the fearful recoil of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
the rifle, with a half-pound shell and twelve drachms of
powder, nearly threw me backwards; but I saw the mark
upon the elephant’s shoulder in an excellent line, although
rather high. The only effect of the shot was to send him off
at great speed towards the jungle. But at the same moment
the three aggageers came galloping across the sand, like greyhounds
in a course, and, judiciously keeping parallel with
the jungle, they cut off his retreat; and, turning towards the
elephant, they confronted him, sword in hand. At once the
furious beast charged straight at the enemy. But now came
the very gallant but foolish part of the hunt. Instead of
leading the elephant by the flight of one man and horse,
according to their usual method, all the aggageers at the
moment sprang from their saddles; and upon foot, in the
heavy sand, they attacked the elephant with their swords.</p>

<p>“In the way of sport, I never saw any thing so magnificent,
or so absurdly dangerous. No gladiatorial exhibition
in the Roman arena could have surpassed this fight. The
elephant was mad with rage; and, nevertheless, he seemed to
know that the object of the hunters was to get behind him.
This he avoided with great dexterity, turning, as it were,
upon a pivot with extreme quickness, and charging headlong,
first at one, and then at another, of his assailants, while he
blew clouds of sand in the air with his trunk, and screamed
with fury. Nimble as monkeys, nevertheless the aggageers
could not get behind him. In the folly of excitement, they
had forsaken their horses, which had escaped from the spot.
The depth of the loose sand was in favor of the elephant,
and was so much against the men, that they avoided his
charges with extreme difficulty. It was only by the determined
pluck of all three, that they alternately saved each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
other; as two invariably dashed in at the flanks when the
elephant charged the third, upon which the wary animal immediately
relinquished the chase, and turned round upon his
pursuers. During this time, I had been laboring through the
heavy sand; and, shortly after I arrived at the fight, the elephant
charged directly through the aggageers, receiving a
shoulder-shot from one of my Reilly No. 10 rifles, and, at
the same time, a slash from the sword of Abou Do, who, with
great dexterity and speed, had closed in behind him, just in
time to save the leg. Unfortunately, he could not deliver
the cut in the right place, as the elephant, with increased
speed, completely distanced the aggageers: he charged across
the deep sand, and reached the jungle. We were shortly
upon his tracks; and, after running about a quarter of a
mile, he fell dead in a dry water-course. His tusks, like the
generality of Abyssinian elephants, were exceedingly short,
but of good thickness.”</p>

<p>The tactics employed in shooting Asiatic elephants are not
always successful when applied to the African species; and
the forehead-shot, referred to in the chapter on hunting the
Asiatic elephant, is rarely made. The only forehead-shot
that Sir S. W. Baker ever made was on the Settite River;
the ball entering the base of the trunk, and lodging in the
vertebræ of the neck,—a chance shot. At fifty feet, the
temple-shot is often made; but the old hunters generally
aim at the shoulder, or just behind it.</p>

<p>The flesh of the elephant is greatly esteemed by some
native Africans, especially the fat; while the feet, when well
cooked, are considered delicacies by some European hunters.</p>

<p>When the Bechuanas obtain a dead elephant, they not
only enter the body, and literally mine for the fat,—hacking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
it out, and passing it to their comrades,—but besmear themselves
with the blood from head to foot, considering that it
will bring them good luck.</p>

<p>The native Africans have never been known to tame or
utilize the elephant: though, in what is known as the fly
country, they are the only animals perfectly free from attack,
and would be of the greatest value, and a great saving of
life, as it is estimated that every tusk that comes out from
the interior of Africa, causes the death of at least one slave
or native.</p>

<p>That the African elephant was hunted in very early times,
is very evident. On an Egyptian tomb at Qournah, of the
time of Thothmes III., there is a representation of the elephant,
telling the story of the tribute brought by the people
of the upper Euphrates to that prince in 1500 B.C. The
celebrated black obelisk (now in the collection of the British
Museum) of Shalmaneser II. (858-823 B.C.) bears a delineation
of an elephant which formed part of a tribute brought
by the Muzri, a people of Kurdistan at the head waters of
the Tigris, to the Assyrian monarch. The human figures on
the stone are shown bearing elephants’ tusks upon their
shoulders.</p>

<p>These inscriptions and figures, while they may be considered a
part of the adornment of obelisks and tombs, are, in
reality, the historical records of the time; and the representations
of the elephant are often of value in showing its
geographical distribution in former times. Thus, according
to the stele of Amenemheb, an officer of the time of Thothmes III.
and Amenophis II., translated by M. Chabas, the
elephant was hunted near Nineveh, in the reign of Thothmes
III.; and that there were found in great numbers, is shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
by the statement, that the king “captured one hundred and
twenty elephants for the sake of their tusks in the country
of Nineveh.” Later than this, according to an Assyrian inscription
on the prism of Tiglath-pileser I. (1120 B.C.), now
in London, the elephant was hunted on the Tigris. The
account translated reads, “I killed ten full-grown elephants
in the country of Harran; and on the banks of the Khabour
[an affluent of the Tigris], I captured four elephants alive.
I brought their skins and their tusks, with the living elephants,
to my city of Alassar” [Asshur].</p>

<span class="smaller">BABY ELEPHANTS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The adult elephant attracts attention because of its great
size and massive proportions; but the baby elephant is
sure of the undisguised admiration of the young folk, for an
exactly opposite reason; and perhaps no animal excites quite
so much interest among all classes.</p>

<p>At least two Asiatic elephants claim America as their
birthplace. The first one was born in Philadelphia in 1880,
where, with its mother, it attracted great attention, people
going from far and near to visit it. The second baby elephant
was born in Bridgeport in 1882, its mother being Mr.
Barnum’s Asiatic elephant Hebe. This infant proboscidian
was named after the city of its birth and has probably been
watched, fed, and petted by hundreds of thousands of children
in the United States.</p>

<p>It is rare that elephants display any great affection for
their young. Sir Emerson Tennent quotes Knox as saying
that “the she’s are alike tender of any one’s young ones, as
of their own.” Mr. Sanderson, in charge of the government
elephants in India, contradicts this, and states that “much
exclusiveness is shown by elephants in the detailed arrangements
amongst themselves in a herd; and if the mothers and
young ones be closely watched, it will be seen that the latter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
are very rarely allowed familiarities by other females, nor,
indeed do they seek them. I have seen,” he says, “many
cases in the Kheddahs where young elephants, after losing
their mothers by death or other causes, have been refused
assistance by the other females and have been buffetted as
outcasts. I have only known one instance of a very gentle,
motherly elephant, in captivity, allowing a motherless calf
to nurse along with her young one.”</p>

<p>The baby Bridgeport weighed at birth two hundred and
forty-five pounds, and commenced nursing an hour and forty
minutes later,—not with its trunk, as was supposed in the
days of Buffon, but with its mouth, like all other mammals.
The young elephants are nourished upon milk until they are
six months old, when they eat a small quantity of tender
grass; but for several months they depend principally upon
milk. A single elephant is usually born at a time, though
occasionally twins are seen among wild elephants. Sometimes
three small elephants are observed about the mother;
but they are generally of different ages, or are twins and a
brother or sister two years and a half older.</p>

<p>The new baby Bridgeport, when I first saw it, was one
of the most interesting creatures possible to imagine. Its
diminutive stature, just about the size of the adult pygmies,
described in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chap. IV.</a>; its short trunk and tail; its pinkish
skin, and small, solemn eyes, made it the most grotesque and
comical little fellow in the world. Like all young animals,
it was quite playful, and its attempts at frisking about were
very amusing. It would seize its mother’s tail or her trunk,
or dart between her colossal legs in a veritable game of hide
and seek, while she looked on with evident pride, displaying
not the slightest alarm when the keeper lifted the baby in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
variety of positions so that Mr. James C. Beard could sketch
it. This is a peculiarity that few mothers in the lower animal
kingdom have; and even the partly wild elephants
seem to have perfect faith in man, trusting their young
with them, and not resenting any familiarity that does not
harm them.</p>

</div>

<p>Among many animals, especially sea-lions, the mortality
of the young, resulting from carelessness or clumsiness on
the part of the parent, is very great; but it is very rarely, if
ever, that a baby elephant is killed or injured. This is true
in the great herds when they are stampeded by various enemies.
When on the march, the mothers and young go in
advance; but when the note of alarm is sounded, they immediately
fall back, the tuskers, or males, going to the front;
and an observer at this time would be astonished at the sudden
disappearance of the young. At the first alarm, they run
to their mother, and place themselves beneath her, shuffling
along in this way; yet so careful are these enormous parents,
that even in travelling at a rapid rate, and crowded by one
another, the babies are never harmed. To this great care on
the part of elephants is, undoubtedly, due the safety of men
who handle these animals; the great brutes being instinctively
careful of all smaller attendants.</p>

<p>In wild Asiatic elephants, the greatest number of births are
during September, October, and November. When a baby
elephant is added to the herd, they remain about the mother
for two or three days, to give the little one an opportunity
to gain strength. The greatest care is given the youngsters
by the mothers. They are assisted over rough places, pushed
up hills, and are never an encumbrance to the movements of
the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps the most amusing sight is witnessed when a herd
with young have to swim deep streams. When the mothers
are once off bottom, very little of their great bodies shows
above the surface; and they often swim or walk with only the
tip of the trunk showing. If the infant is very young, or
there is danger of its taking cold, the old one takes it in her
trunk, and holds it above the water as she swims: others are
supported at the surface. Older babies scramble upon the
mother’s back, and ride along with only the curious cushions
of their feet in the water; while some sit astride the old one’s
back, holding on with their legs.</p>

<p>The baby elephant does not lack courage. Sir Emerson
Tennent states that once when a herd of elephants was captured,
two tiny elephants were entrapped with them,—one
about ten months old, whose head was covered with brown
curly hair, and the other a little older. They both kept
with the herd, trotting in and out between the legs of their
elders, being caressed by all. According to the same writer,
when the mother of the youngest was singled out by the
noosers, and was dragged along, the little one followed,
showing great indignation at the proceedings, and prevented
them from putting a second noose over the mother; running
in between her and the natives, trying to seize the rope, and
pushing and striking them with its diminutive trunk, until
it became so annoying that it had to be captured and carried
away by main force. Even then it resisted, shrieking loudly,
stopping to look back at every step; but finally it attached
itself to a large female, and stood by her fore-legs, and
moaned continually. After a while, however, it made its
escape, and returned to its dam; and when recovered, both
babies shrieked lustily, struck at the men with their trunks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
and twisted their little bodies into many curious contortions.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most laughable part of this scene was, that the
babies would eagerly seize any article of food that was thrown
them, and still keep on screaming all the while they were
eating.</p>

<p>These interesting infants were afterwards sent down to
Colombo, to the house of Sir Emerson Tennent, and became
great pets. “One,” he says, “attached himself especially to
the coachman, who had a little shed erected for him near his
own quarters at the stables. But his favorite resort was the
kitchen, where he received a daily allowance of milk and
plantains, and picked up several little delicacies besides.
He was innocent and playful in the extreme; and, when
walking in the grounds, he would trot up to me, twine his
little trunk around my arm, and coax me to take him to
the fruit-trees. In the evening the grass-cutters, now and
then, indulged him by permitting him to carry home a load
of fodder for the horses, on which occasions he assumed an
air of great gravity that was highly amusing, showing that
he was deeply impressed with the importance and responsibility
of the service intrusted to him. Being sometimes permitted
to enter the dining-room, and helped to fruit at dessert,
he at last learned his way to the sideboard; and on more
than one occasion, having stolen in during the absence of the
servants, he made a clean sweep of the wineglasses and china,
in his endeavors to reach a basket of oranges. For these and
other pranks, we were at last obliged to put him away.”</p>

<span class="smaller">TRICK ELEPHANTS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The readiness of the elephant to familiarize itself with
various tricks has been recognized from very early
times, and the list of accomplishments which these unwieldy
creatures have acquired is a long and interesting one. To
the circus of the present day, the elephant is invaluable.
People tire of the old jokes of the clown, and of the time-worn
bare-back riding, but the elephant possesses a peculiar
fascination; and, the more it is observed, the more there is to
admire. This was, I think, particularly true of Jumbo, who,
though he had no tricks to display, was a never-failing source
of interest. I remember on one occasion, when afforded an
opportunity of entering his stable alone, I stood for a long
time noting the monotonous, pendulum-like movement of
the enormous head and trunk as it swayed from side to side;
and so huge did he appear, and withal so wonderful, such a
giant of flesh and bone, that I could have extended my visit
a long time without becoming wearied with its monotony.
I think this is true to a great extent with all elephants.
They are so wonderful and stupendous, that they do not wear
upon the public patience.</p>

<p>The education of the elephant is quite an important matter;
and in nearly all the large herds, like Barnum’s, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
are what might be called elephant schools, where the elephants
are not only taught, but kept in practice. Kindness
is a feature of this education; but fear is the motive, after all,
on the part of the elephant; and were it not for the dread
which the hook of the trainer inspires, there would be little
discipline maintained.</p>

<p>The trainer of the Barnum herd informed me that he had
often seen elephants, especially young ones, practising their
lessons out of school. On one occasion he looked through a
crevice into the pen of the elephants who were fastened up
for the night, and there was one trying to stand on its head.
While he watched, it made the attempt several times, just as
if he had been standing by, and finally succeeded. Some of
my young readers may possibly think that this is a remarkable
evidence of intelligence, but I am inclined to think that
it was merely the result of the force of daily habit.</p>

<p>As long ago as the time of Pliny, elephants were observed
studying their lessons, if so we may term it. This ancient
author tells us that an elephant, having been punished for his
inaptitude in executing some feat which he was required to
learn, was observed at night endeavoring to practise what he
had vainly attempted during the day; and Plutarch confirms
this by mentioning an elephant who practised his theatrical
attitudes, alone, by moonlight.</p>

<p>The elephants of to-day are trained to march like soldiers,
to wheel and counter-march at command, to salute their
superior by throwing up the trunk and whistling loudly, to
build pyramids and climb upon eminences; and one small
elephant has been taught to walk upon a rope,—a very
broad and flat one. Elephants upon the see-saw, upon a
rolling ball, elephants upon their hind-legs, and dancing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
elephants,—all are familiar to the circus-goer; and to show to
what perfection the art of animal-training has attained, quite
recently two small Indian elephants, which were erroneously
advertised as mammoths in New York, from the fact that
they had some hair upon their heads and bodies, were educated
to do some comical tricks, one of which was to ride a
tricycle, in which position they presented a most ludicrous
appearance. (<a href="#plate16">See Plate XVI.</a>)</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable exhibition is that afforded
by the little elephant, Tom Thumb, of the Barnum circus,
the one who was in the accident which killed Jumbo. This
elephant comes walking upon his hind-legs upon a mimic
stage, with an alleged German, and both take seats at a
table; the elephant being dressed in hat, coat, and trousers.
The clown elephant now takes a bell in its trunk, and rings
it; a waiter coming in and taking the order, which is evidently
for some intoxicant. When he returns with a bottle
and two glasses, the elephant seizes the former while his
companion is not looking, and drinks the contents. This
act is repeated a number of times, the elephant ringing the
bell and ordering another bottle before the German discovers
the fraud. Then the elephant appears to be overcome with
the wine, and, taking a fan in its trunk, uses it vigorously.
In all its movements the curious animal acts exactly as if it
understood all that was going on, and fully appreciated the
sport.</p>

<p>It is not often that an elephant is employed as a witness
in court, but such an instance occurred in Cleveland some
time ago. The famous trick elephant Pickaninny had been
exhibited there; and, as some discussion had been raised as
to its speed, a test was given, the trainer affirming that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
elephant could travel three miles in thirty minutes. It
accomplished a mile in eight minutes and the officers of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals very properly
interfered and arrested the driver charging him with
having prodded the animal with an iron until the blood
came.</p>

<p>The next day the parties appeared in court, and the trainer
subpœned his elephant in his defence. As the animal could
not squeeze up the stairs to the police court, the latter was
held in the corridor below. When asked if he had been
injured, Pickaninny moved his head negatively; and when
the inquiry was made if he was treated well, he bobbed his
head up and down, and grunted his assent in a very decided
manner. It is unnecessary to say that his trainer was not
far off during this performance; and as examination failed to
show any wounds, the man was discharged, and the elephant
complimented upon his success by being presented with
loaves of bread, fruit, and other delicacies.</p>

<p>The elephant has figured in the circus of England for at
least two hundred and fifty years; and in 1681 a fine specimen
was accidentally destroyed by fire in Dublin. The
exhibition price had been so high that comparatively few
persons had seen it; and at the time of the fire, the poorer
classes hunted for pieces of the flesh as relics, which shows
what a novel spectacle an elephant must have been at this
time.</p>

<p>Among the first trained elephants exhibited in Europe,
was a fine Asiatic animal, employed at the Adelphi Theatre,
London. It took part in an Eastern play, and evoked much
applause by marching in a procession, kneeling before the
king, and saluting the true prince without apparent orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>One of the first elephants seen in London was kept in the
Tower of London in the seventeenth century, and was a gift
to Henry III. from Louis IX. of France. It was probably
obtained from Africa when the French king invaded that
country. The order relating to this elephant is still extant
among the old archives, and reads thus: “We command you,
that, of the farm of our city, ye cause, without delay, to be
built at our Tower of London, one house of forty feet long,
and twenty feet deep, for our elephant.”</p>

<p>It was evidently quite the custom among monarchs to send
elephants to one another. Emmanuel of Portugal sent a fine
one to Pope Leo X. and Cardan describes one that he saw
in the sixteenth century, at the court of the Queen of Bohemia,
the daughter of Charles the Fifth. As early as 802,
Haroun-al-Raschid, caliph of the Saracens, sent one to
Charlemagne.</p>

<p>The elephants of Germanicus were trained to perform
many remarkable feats, as hurling javelins into the air with
their trunks, and catching them. Pliny says that these elephants
danced upon a rope, and their steps were so practised
and certain, that four of them walked upon the rope, bearing
a litter, which contained one of their companions who feigned
to be sick. This would seem an exaggeration, but an elephant
upon the tight-rope has been seen in this country; and
ancient writers agree with Pliny that the elephants exhibited
at ancient Rome could not only walk upon the rope, but
retreat backwards without falling off. This performance,
wonderful as it appears, is credited by nearly all the old
writers. Seneca describes an elephant, who, at the command
of its keeper, would bow its head, kneel, and walk upon a
rope. Of course, it is impossible for an elephant to walk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
upon a slack rope; and those alluded to were probably of
very large size, perhaps flat upon the sides, and stretched to
the greatest tension, and placed near the ground.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that, in some cases, the rope was
high above the spectators; as one writer mentions an elephant
exhibited in the presence of the Emperor Galba, which
ascended to the roof of the circus, on a rope stretched in an
incline, and came back in safety, bearing a man upon its
back.</p>

<p>This performance is extremely wonderful when we remember
the natural timidity of the animal, and the almost impossibility
of forcing it upon a structure that is in the
least unstable or frail. When elephants are marched over
a bridge, they exercise the greatest caution, often trying
the boards before taking the step, and displaying much
sagacity.</p>

<p>We have seen the elephant of to-day fire a gun, play upon
the hand-organ, or ring a bell: and Arrian mentions seeing
an elephant who played upon the cymbals, having one
attached to each knee, and bearing the third in its proboscis;
thus beating a measure with great exactness, while other
elephants danced about him. Busbec, ambassador from Germany
to Constantinople in 1555, saw an elephant which he
describes as an extremely graceful dancer and ball-player,
throwing the ball, and catching it, as easily as could a man
with his hands.</p>

<p>It is a common thing for parrots to be taught to scream
out the name of prominent people, and elephants have been
trained to perform a somewhat similar trick. Thus, an elephant
saluted Domitian when he passed; and when the elephant
presented by Emmanuel of Portugal saw Leo X., to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
whom he was sent as a gift, it fell upon its knees, and made
a profound obeisance.</p>

<p>By far the best-trained elephant which was ever exhibited
in London, was owned by the Duke of Devonshire, who obtained
the animal in a curious manner. On being asked by
a lady <i>en route</i> for India, what she should bring him, he replied
jokingly, “Ah! nothing less than an elephant.” A few
months later, he was astonished at receiving the animal,
whose actions and intelligence were the admiration of the
country.</p>

<p>The elephant was kept in a large enclosure, and treated
with every kindness and attention, and developed a remarkable
intelligence, soon learning to assist in many ways the
man who was employed to take care of it. At his request
it would go to him, take a broom, and sweep the paths or
grass wherever he indicated, using her trunk to perform the
work, with as much ease as a man would his hands. When
he was watering the garden, it would follow him around,
carrying the water-pot; always being rewarded for its faithful
services with a carrot, or some other vegetable. The
keeper soon found that the elephant was adroit at work
of any kind. When given a bottle, it uncorked it itself, by
pressing it against the ground with its foot, and holding it at
an angle of forty-five degrees, carefully pulling the cork out
with its trunk. When this feat was often tried for the entertainment
of the duke’s friends, a soda-water bottle was
used, in which the cork projected a very little above the
edge. When the bottle was uncorked, she would turn her
trunk around, so as to reverse it, and drink the contents
with much gusto, then handing the bottle to the attendant.</p>

<p>Another trick it performed was equally applauded. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
was to take off its blanket without the aid of its trunk.
When the attendant rode it, he covered its back with a large
cloth; and, when he wished to dismount, it would kneel,
then rise, and, at the word of command, begin to agitate the
muscles of its loins in such a manner that the housing was
soon wriggled off, upon which it would take and fold it with
exactness, and then toss it upon the centre of its back.</p>

<p>Such an animal naturally became a great favorite, and, at
the time, was as famous as Jumbo. It displayed great affection
for its keeper; and it is needless to say, that it was returned.
The first keeper attended it for eight years; and,
when he left, it seemed to mourn, and showed a disposition
to resent the advances of the new attendant, but was gradually
won over by kindness, and finally would cry lustily for
him if he remained away what it considered too long a time.
This famous elephant died of consumption in 1829, in the
prime of life, being about twenty-one years of age.</p>

<span class="smaller">ELEPHANTS AND THEIR FRIENDS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>All animals have their favorites or friends,—it may be
some attendant or some animal to which they have
formed an attachment,—and the elephant is no exception to
the rule. Most of the latter’s friends are made in confinement;
but the wild animal has a number of little companions,
which are of great value, at least, in adding to its comfort.
These are birds; and chief among them is a beautiful crane,
which is often seen—and, indeed, numbers of them—perched
upon the back of the great animal, and riding about, presenting
a strange and decided contrast to the dark-skinned proboscidian.
The presence of these shy birds moving about
on so curious a roost would seem a mystery; but, should we
watch them, we should see that they were performing a most
friendly act. They walk over the great, wrinkled back, and
with their sharp eyes spy out all the insects which infest the
great pachyderm, picking them out, and so securing a dinner
and serving their friend at the same time, who probably is
often driven to desperation by the myriads of insect-torments
which abound in the dark continent. Besides the cranes,
there are several smaller birds which are equally friendly
to the king of beasts, and often congregate upon its back in
great numbers; running about without fear, clinging to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
huge ears, now dangling by the tail, and performing a still
more friendly act at times in warning their friend of danger
by rising in a flock, and uttering shrill cries, which arouse
the drowsy elephant to a sense of its danger.</p>

<p>In confinement particularly, the elephant is famous for its
friendships, attaching itself to certain persons or animals,
showing its affection for them in various ways. One of the
Barnum elephants formed a strong friendship for a large dog,
which was fully reciprocated; the dog sleeping with its great
friend, and always remaining about its feet. If it strayed
away at any time, the elephant would look after it, and on
its return show its delight and pleasure in many ways.</p>

<p>Elephants often become attached to children, and seem to
display the greatest solicitude for them. They have been
employed as nurses to extremely small children, performing
the duties as care-taker with perfect satisfaction.</p>

<p>Though, as a rule, elephants obey their keepers from fear,
there are cases where a decided friendship exists; and even
when furious with rage, an elephant will often obey its keeper’s
voice. An affecting instance of this was seen in the case
of the famous elephant Chuni, who was believed to have gone
mad. The animal was taken out to be shot; and its keeper
was obliged to order it to kneel, that the soldiers might shoot
it. The man reluctantly gave the order; and the elephant
obeyed the command, and fell, pierced by many bullets.</p>

<p>A mad elephant in Germany, which had destroyed much
property, yielded immediately to the voice of the man who
owned it, or had been its friend and keeper. The works of
the ancient writers abound in instances of attachment and
friendship between the huge animals and human beings.
Ælian relates a story of an elephant who became passionately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
attached to a little girl who sold flowers in the streets of
Antioch, and had occasionally given it a part of her store.
Athenæus tells of one which became so fond of a little
child, that it would eat only in its presence; but I fear that
this story will not stand the test. Strabo states that elephants
were known to have pined away and died when deprived
of their keepers to whom they were attached. Lieut.
Shipp gives, in his memoirs, a very minute account of an elephant,
who, upon killing its keeper, was seized with what
was considered a fit of remorse, which ultimately killed the
animal. In other words, it died of “a broken heart,” a term
that is applied to-day to elephants in India who die of no
apparent cause.</p>

<p>In Purchas’s collection of travels, there is an account of
an elephant who mourned for its master, the King of Ava,
who was slain in battle, for many days; and, as the same is
known to have occurred among dogs and cats at the present
day, it is not at all improbable.</p>

<p>That the elephant should become attached to its keeper, is
not strange. It is perfectly familiar with all his movements,
receives all its food from him, is caressed and petted; and it
is not surprising that at times the animals rebel when provided
with an utter stranger to replace the one in whom they
have learned to trust.</p>

<span class="smaller">TUSKERS AT WORK.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>We have seen how the elephant is trapped, glanced at
it in confinement, and now come to the question of
its actual value; in other words, how it is utilized by man.
The simplest answer to this would be, that the elephant is a
patient and faithful servant, quick to oblige, and, though not
the most valuable of all animals as a helpmate to man, it certainly
stands first in this respect in India.</p>

<p>In the chapter on elephant intelligence, the traits of the
great animal are dwelt upon; and it is its quickness to obey
orders, the celerity with which it seems to understand them,
its great strength and docility, which make it so valuable.
There is hardly any service in India, requiring heavy work,
in which the elephant is not employed. All the native nobles
keep large herds of them, and in early times the numbers
employed for simple purposes of show were remarkable.</p>

<p>The tuskers are valued the most; as with their stout tusks
they lift lumber, and do much heavy labor, the trunk being
used less than is generally supposed. In lifting a heavy burden
by a rope, the male elephant does not haul by its trunk,
but places it over one tusk, and takes the end with its teeth,
and thus has a purchase that the female, who relies upon her
teeth alone, does not possess. Long tusks are not necessary;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
in fact, in confinement they are cut once a year at least, to
prevent the animals from injuring themselves. This operation
is performed by making the animal lie down in the
water, and sawing the tusk off; the rule being, according to
Sanderson, to measure from the eyes to the insertion of the
tusk in the lip; this length measured from the latter point
along the tusk, will give the spot where it should be cut. In
young animals, a little more should be allowed; as the above
measurement may approach to nearly the medullary pulp of
the tusk.</p>

<p>Before the introduction of the railway in India, the elephant
was used entirely to transport troops. Both male and
female are now employed as laborers. In hunting, the tuskers
are chiefly selected, on account of their superior courage;
and in following the tiger in India, they are almost invariably
of great value, especially in Bengal, where the places frequented
by this animal are often covered by high grass. In
these hunts, only elephants whose courage has been tested
are used, the hunters riding in the howdah upon their backs.</p>

<p>There is danger, however, in having an elephant which is
too courageous. Such a one will, if not under perfect control,
become enraged at the very sight of a tiger, and charge
it, often with lamentable results to the hunters in the howdah,
who are liable to be shaken out, and crushed to death.
In 1876, at Dacca, an elephant acted in this way. A gentleman
had taken his courageous wife on a tiger-hunt, both
being in the howdah on a female elephant. Suddenly a large
tigress ran across an open place; and the elephant, despite
the commands of the mahout, charged immediately, under the
influence of terror and excitement, or rage. The hunter
fired, and rolled the tigress over in front of the elephant, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
began to kick at the prostrate brute, who, in turn, grasped
the hind-leg of the elephant, and scratched, bit, and pulled
with such vehemence that the elephant was fairly pulled over
upon it, fortunately killing the tigress instantly.</p>

<p>When the elephant went down, the sportsman was thrown
violently out, his rifle flying in another direction, and going
off, fortunately without damage to any one. His wife managed
to retain her place, and was safely helped out by her
husband, both running to another elephant, and so escaping
without harm.</p>

<p>This calls to mind the method of an English major, also a
reputed famous hunter of former days. It is said that he
had killed twelve hundred elephants in his time. He made
a wager that he could kill two of these animals at one shot,
and won, by shooting a female so that it fell upon its calf
and killed it.</p>

<p>The elephant, as we have seen, is very solicitous of its
trunk, and, when attacked by a tiger, holds it high in air; and
if by any accident this member is injured, the mahout sometimes
loses command. Mr. Williamson thus describes such
an occurrence which happened to two officers of the Bengal
army:—</p>

<p>“They had been in the habit of killing tigers with only
one elephant, on which being mounted, they one day roused
a tiger of a very fierce disposition. The animal, after doing
some mischief among the dogs, which baited him very courageously,
at length darted at the elephant’s head, and, though
foiled in the attempt to get upon it, nevertheless scratched
her trunk severely. No sooner did she feel the tiger’s claws
penetrating her proboscis, than she turned round, and set off
at full speed, roaring most vehemently. She seemed to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
lost her senses, and to be bent on mischief; for whenever
she saw a living object, she pursued it, totally heedless of the
mahout’s endeavors to guide or restrain her. She was at
length, by fatigue and management, brought into a governable
state; but she was spoiled for tiger-hunting.”</p>

<p>The same author chronicles a narrow escape for both elephant
and riders from a tiger:—</p>

<p>“The tiger had satiated himself upon a bullock he had
killed, and lay lurking in the grass,—which was as high as
the backs of the elephants, and very thick,—not far from the
remains of the bullock. He was extremely cunning, and
crouched so close as to render it, for a long time, doubtful
whether he was in the jungle, or not. The symptoms displayed
by the elephants, on approaching the place where he
lay concealed, induced the party to persevere in their efforts
to rouse him. One gentleman, particularly, urged his mahout
to make his elephant beat the spot where the scent was
strongest; which being done, in spite of the tremendous
tones of the agitated animal, the tiger, finding himself compelled
either to resist, or to submit to being trodden upon,
sprang upon the elephant’s quarter, and so far succeeded as
to fix his claws in the pad; his hind-legs were somewhat
spread, and their claws were fixed into the fleshy membranes
of the elephant’s thigh. Actuated by the excess of fear, occasioned
by so sudden and so painful an attack, the elephant
dashed through the cover at a surprising rate; the tiger holding
fast by its fore-paws, and supported by its hinder ones,
unable, however, in consequence of the rapid and irregular
motions of the elephant, either to raise himself any higher,
or to quit the hold he had so firmly taken with his claws.
The gentleman, who had much ado to keep his seat, was precluded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
from firing at his grim companion, as well from his
unprecedented situation, as from the great danger of wounding
some of the numerous followers, who were exerting the
utmost speed of their respective elephants to come up to his
assistance. The constant desire felt by the elephant to get
rid of his unwelcome rider, which produced a waving and
irregular pace, gave the opportunity for those who were
mounted on light and speedy animals to overtake the singular
fugitives. Another gentleman of the party, coming up
close, was enabled to choose his position; when, taking a safe
aim, he shot the tiger, which fell to the ground, and required
no further operations.”</p>

<p>An elephant has been known to fling a tiger twenty feet
through the air, and well-trained animals will catch a leaping
tiger upon its tusks. This, however, is rarely done, perhaps
from lack of opportunity. Much preparation is required in
training an elephant for tiger-hunting. A stuffed skin is
generally thrown to them, and they are taught to kneel and
crush it; and, when thoroughly familiar with the appearance
of the big cat through the dummy, they are taken into the
field.</p>

<p>In India the elephant has often been used as a public
executioner. Shah-Jehan terrified the Portuguese at Hoogly
some years ago by announcing, that, if they did not renounce
the Christian faith, he would throw them beneath his elephants’
feet. Knox, in his account of Ceylon, states that
“the king makes use of them for executioners,” and that the
animals would run their tusks through the bodies of the victims
at the word of command. These elephant executioners
were provided with sharp iron spikes with a socket with
three edges, which at such times were fitted upon their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
tusks. This custom was kept up until the British conquered
the island.</p>

<p>Bishop Heber says, “I preached, administered the sacrament,
and confirmed twenty-six young people, in the audience-hall
of the late King of Kandy, which now serves as a church.
Here, twelve years ago, this man, who was a dreadful tyrant,
and lost his throne in consequence of a large party of his
subjects applying to Gen. Brownrigge for protection, used,
as we were told, to sit in state to see those whom he had
condemned trodden to death and tortured by elephants
trained for the purpose.”</p>

<p>In very early times the elephant formed an equally important
factor in the hunt. Marco Polo has recorded the manner
of the Grand Khan’s proceeding to the sport:—</p>

<p>“On account of the narrowness of the passes in some parts
of the country where his Majesty follows the chase, he is
borne upon two elephants only, or sometimes a single one,
being more convenient than a greater number. But, under
other circumstances, he makes use of four, upon the backs
of which is placed a pavilion of wood, handsomely carved,
the inside being lined with cloth of gold, and the outside
covered with the skins of lions,—a mode of conveyance
which is rendered necessary to him during his hunting excursions,
in consequence of the gout, with which his Majesty is
troubled. In the pavilion he always carries with him twelve
of his best gerfalcons, with twelve officers, from amongst his
favorites, to bear him company and amuse him. Those who
are on horseback by his side give him notice of the approach
of cranes, or other birds, upon which he raises the curtain of
the pavilion, and, when he espies the game, gives direction
for letting fly the gerfalcons, which seize the cranes, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
overpower them after a long struggle. The view of this
sport, as he lies upon his couch, affords extreme satisfaction
to his Majesty.”</p>

<p>The Nawaub of Oude, Vizier Ally, or Asoplul-Doulah,
who was elevated to the throne through the British, was
even more prodigal than the Grand Khan:—</p>

<p>“He generally took the field in the month of March,
accompanied by ten thousand cavalry and as many infantry,
and from seven to eight hundred elephants. From forty to
sixty thousand people followed the camp, with grain and
merchandise. When the vizier set out from his palace at
Lucknow, a line was formed with the prince in the centre,
mounted on an elephant, with two attendant elephants,—one
carrying his state howdah, the other his sporting howdah.
A line of elephants was prolonged on each side the prince,
and was flanked at each extremity by the cavalry. The
immense cavalcade proceeded straight through the country,
regardless of the mischief that was a necessary consequence;
the poor cultivators running after the vizier, crying aloud
for mercy. When any game was started, a continual fire
was kept up along the line; and, if a herd of antelopes was
discovered, the elephants halted, and the cavalry hemmed
them in, that his Highness and his courtiers might leisurely
destroy them. Proceeding in this manner by day, and halting
in the evening at appointed stations, where every luxury
was prepared in sumptuous tents, the army at length approached
the Thibet Mountains, where tigers, panthers,
leopards, and buffaloes were to be found. An encampment
being formed, their sporting was continued for several weeks
upon a grand and formidable scale; and, mounted upon their
elephants, the prince and his nobles scoured the country in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
pursuit of the ferocious beasts that destroyed the flocks and
herds of the peasantry. The array of despotism was here
of some service, for the numbers of carnivorous animals that
were killed was generally in proportion to the magnitude of
the force employed against them.”</p>

<p>The curious uses to which elephants have been put are
endless. An English officer, who served in India, says, “I
have myself seen the wife of a mahout [for the followers
often take their families with them to camp] give a baby in
charge of an elephant while she went on some business, and
have been highly amused in observing the sagacity and care
of the unwieldy nurse. The child, which, like most children,
did not like to lie still in one position, would, as soon
as left to itself, begin crawling about, in which exercise it
would probably get among the legs of the animal, or entangled
in the branches of the trees on which he was feeding;
when the elephant would, in the most tender manner, disengage
his charge, either by lifting it out of the way with
his trunk, or by removing the impediments to its free progress.
If the child had crawled to such a distance as to verge upon
the limits of his range [for the animal was chained by the
leg to a peg driven into the ground], he would stretch out
his trunk, and lift it back as gently as possible to the spot
whence it had started.”</p>

<p>M. D’Obsonville observed two elephants engaged in breaking
down a wall at the command of the mahouts, who stood
by, imploring, ordering, and coaxing by turns. The trunks
of these animals were protected by leather shields.</p>

<p>At Barrackpoor, there was an elephant in the early part of
this century, noted for its intelligence in working without
a mahout. Once loaded with parcels, it would enter the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
Ganges, swim across, and then unload itself. Another elephant,
who was kept near the fort at Trarancore, was employed
to carry out the treasure-boxes of the rájah of
Trarancore. It was totally unattended, and marched solemnly
into the court-yard of the fort, bearing a box, repeating
this until all the boxes were piled up in regular order.</p>

<p>It was reported in the press soon after Lord Dufferin had
been appointed viceroy to India, that he had been presented
with an elephant paper-cutter, which if true,—and it is not
by any means improbable,—would be one of the singular uses
to which an elephant was ever put, and perhaps the most
expensive. As the story goes, the tusks of a fine young
elephant were beautifully carved into the shape of the huge
paper-cutters now so fashionable; and the animal itself was
taught to take an uncut pamphlet or book in its trunk, and
cut the leaves.</p>

<p>The greatest practical value of the elephant is seen in
their work as laborers; and in hauling lumber they are
especially of great service, their great strength enabling
them to haul logs from localities that are ordinarily inaccessible.
At Moulmien these huge laborers can often be seen
at work in the lumber-yards, and observers say that their
power is most advantageously employed where great exertion
is required for a short distance in a limited space of time.</p>

<p>In the above-mentioned yards they may be seen carrying
huge timbers, sometimes two or three animals engaged at
one, exercising the greatest care and exactitude in the work,
and obeying the slightest sign of the mahout. In lifting a
heavy burden, the plank is edged or helped on to the tusks
with the trunk, which is then wound around to steady it,
while all the strain comes upon the tusks. (<a href="#plate13">See Plate XIII.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>In hauling, a regular harness is employed, which consists
of a leather collar that goes about the neck; or sometimes a
girth, a stout rope ninety feet in length that fits behind the
shoulders. To either of these the dragging-rope is attached;
and if it is strong, and the elephant has not been frightened
by frequent breakings, occasioned by the carelessness of
drivers, it will make the most extraordinary endeavors and
exertions to draw heavy loads, often bending forward so that
its forehead almost touches the ground.</p>

<p>When light timber is to be hauled, a rope is fastened to
the end of the log, and taken by the elephant between its
teeth, and dragged along, the end elevated from the ground.</p>

<p>Elephants are also harnessed to wagons just as horses.
Travellers through Bridgeport some years ago were entertained
by seeing one of Mr. Barnum’s elephants harnessed
to a plough, but it is very likely that the broad feet of the
animal tramped down the earth about as fast as it was
loosened up.</p>

<p>At the elephant establishment at Dacca, two regular elephant
carts are used, to which are harnessed these animals,
and employed in removing the refuse about the stables.</p>

<p>While the elephant can carry a very heavy burden, it is
exceedingly susceptible to gall; almost every elephant in use,
where great care is not taken, having a sore back. The
natives, not especially humane, are apt to purposely neglect
the animal, and allow its back to become sore; as, if the
elephant cannot be used, they are relieved from duty. Sharp
elephant owners prevent this by putting the attendants on
half pay for as many weeks or months as it takes the poor
creatures to recover. Elephants can be used in countries
where a carriage would be impossible, and can carry a greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
load than can be packed on a large wagon; hence they are
highly valued in a rocky and rough country. In such a
place, a different gear is used from that already described.
It consists of a thick, soft-padded cloth that covers the entire
back, hanging down half way to the ground. Upon this the
saddle fits, consisting of two large pads or sacks, each about
two and a half feet broad, and six feet in length, and filled
with a mass of dried grass or cocoanut fibre, so that they are
about a foot thick. They are connected by cross-pieces, so
that they fit one each side of the animals’ backbone, the
skin of which is thus protected from galling. Upon these
pads another large one is placed, and upon this the load is
packed; so that the weight rests upon the ribs on each side
of the vertebræ, as the weight of a rider on horseback.</p>

<p>The weight that can be loaded on an elephant depends upon
the size of the animal. An ordinary elephant can carry half
a ton continuously on a level country, but in a hilly district
seven hundred-weight is a good load. Female elephants have
been known to carry a pile of rice-bags, weighing twenty-four
hundred pounds, for a short distance; but the regulation
amount allowed by the Bengal commissariat is sixteen
hundred and forty pounds, exclusive of attendants, harness,
chains, etc., which is estimated at three hundred pounds extra.</p>

<p>The magnificent howdahs, or saddles, used by some of the
rájahs are extremely heavy. Thus, one of the silver state
howdahs and trappings of his excellency the viceroy weighs a
little over half a ton; or, to be more exact,—</p>

<p>Elephants are often used, as we use saddle-horses, as steeds
by European officers in India; and a light, well-broken elephant
has an easy motion quite agreeable. The Meerga
caste, or breed, from their long limbs, are generally the fastest;
while small calves are often employed, the rider sitting
astride as in horseback-riding. A large saddle and stirrup
is used; and in rough country, the little fellows are a welcome
addition to the travellers’ party.</p>

<p>Elephants are very sure-footed at their work, and, when
going at full speed, rarely stumble; if they do, they only go
upon the knees. Like horses, they will run away at times;
and a bolting elephant is much more to be dreaded than a
bucking horse.</p>

<p>The Mysore officer in charge of elephants says, “I have
felt, on the one or two occasions which I have been on a
bolting elephant, as a man might feel if bestriding a runaway
locomotive, and hooking the funnel with the crook of his
walking-stick to hold it in. It is a very difficult thing,” he
says, “to cure a confirmed bolter, as the habit has its origin
in fear; and the animal is always liable to be startled by
unexpected sounds or sights, chiefly the former. It is a rare
trick, however; and I have only known two elephants subject
to it. One was a fine baggage animal, but almost useless for
jungle-work from tins trick. I, however, cured him in the
following way: I had a stout hoop of iron made with sharp
spikes on the inside, to encircle one of his hind-legs. This
was kept in its place round the leg by being suspended from
the pad by a rope; and it fitted the leg loosely, so as not to
inconvenience the elephant except when required to do so.
To the ring was attached a chain fifteen feet long, at the
other end of which was a pickaxe’s head. This grappling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
apparatus was slung to the pad by a small cord in a slip-knot,
handy to the mahout. If the elephant began to run, one
pull freed it; and before the anchor had been dragged many
yards, it caught in the roots or bushes, and brought the elephant
up with such a twinge, that it soon began to think
twice before making off.”</p>

<p>The howdah is an ornamental covered saddle; though
some resemble small houses, and cost their owners vast
sums of money. They are used on state occasions, and in
tiger-hunting. The motion is hard, and rather unpleasant to
the novice. Another saddle is called a chárjámá. It is
merely a broad board with cushions upon it, and footboards
attached to each side. There is a rail upon each end; and
four persons sit upon it, two on each side, back to back,
somewhat after the fashion of a jaunting car.</p>

<p>Riding-elephants will travel at about four miles an hour,
while some long-legged fellows will make five or more miles
in this time. Wounded elephants, as we have seen, sometimes
make remarkable time.</p>

<p>Concerning the motion of elephants, Bishop Heber says,—</p>

<p>“At Barrackpoor, for the first time I mounted an elephant,
the motion of which I thought far from disagreeable, though
very different from that of a horse. As the animal moves
both feet on the same side at once, the sensation is like that
of being carried on a man’s shoulders. A full-grown elephant
carries two persons in the howdah, besides the mahout,
who sits on his neck, and a servant on the crupper behind.
The howdah itself, which Europeans use, is not unlike the
body of a small gig, but without a head.”</p>

<p>Capt. Williamson says,—</p>

<p>“The gait of an elephant is very peculiar, being similar to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
the artificial pace of ambling taught to some horses. It is far
from displeasing in a horse, but causes such a motion, when
mounted on an elephant, as rarely to be borne for any distance.
Indeed, I know nothing more uncomfortable and
tedious, I may even say painful, than a long journey in a
howdah. It occasions a lassitude not to be described. We
must suppose that habit reconciles people to it; as we see the
natives travel, for perhaps twenty miles or more in a forenoon,
without any apparent uneasiness. The largest elephants
are, in general, the most uncomfortable in this
respect.”</p>

<p>In mounting an elephant, the animal either kneels, or a
ladder is used to climb upon its back; while natives descend
by means of a rope. Generally a mahout, or professional
driver, is employed to guide the elephant. Mr. Crawford
states, that in his time this was not always the practice in
Ava. He says,—</p>

<p>“After the elephant combats were over, the king prepared
to take his departure. His elephant, one of the noblest animals
I have ever seen, having the trunk, head, and part of
the neck, of a white flesh-color, and in other respects altogether
perfect, was brought up close to the shed under
which we were sitting; and he mounted it with great agility,
placed himself upon the neck of the animal, took the hook
in his hand, and seemed to be perfectly at home in this employment.
We afterwards saw the heir-apparent, a child of
thirteen years of age, guiding his elephant in the same way.
This practice is, I believe, peculiar to the Burmans; for, in
Western India at least, no person of condition ever condescends
to guide his own elephant. There is, at least, some
manliness in the custom; and I should not be surprised to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
find that the neck of the elephant would be found, on experience,
the most agreeable and easy seat to the rider.”</p>

<p>The Emperor Akbar, in the same manner, rode every kind
of elephant, making them obedient to his command.</p>

<p>Timour’s elephant team is described by Sir John Mandeville
as presenting a remarkable appearance: “A chariot with
four wheels, upon which is a fair chamber of sweet-smelling
lignum aloes, which is within covered with plates of fine gold,
dubbed with precious stones and great pearls, and drawn by
four elephants.” Jehanghir rode through the streets of his
capital on an elephant, followed by “twenty royal elephants
for his own ascending, so rich, that in precious stones and
furniture they braved the sun.”</p>

<p>The famous tree-mound of Kublai Khan was built by the
aid of elephants. “Not far from the palace,” says an old
writer, “on the northern side, and about a bow-shot distance
from the surrounding wall, is an artificial mound of earth,
the height of which is full an hundred paces, and the circuit
at the base about a mile. It is clothed with the most beautiful
evergreen-trees: for, whenever his majesty receives information
of a handsome tree growing in any place, he causes
it to be dug up; however large and heavy it may be, he has
it transported by elephants to this mount.”</p>

<p>When Timour built his great mosque at Samarcand, he
employed ninety-five elephants to draw the stones. In the
early days of ship-building in India, these huge animals were
engaged to haul the vessels from the stocks; and Verthema,
who travelled in India in 1503, gives the following example
of their power:—</p>

<p>“I saw an instance of the extraordinary strength of these
animals while at Cananore, where some Mahometans endeavored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
to draw a ship on the land, stern foremost, upon
three rollers; on which occasion three elephants, commodiously
applied, drew with great force, and, bending their
heads down to the ground, brought the ship on the land.”</p>

<p>Another writer states that he saw a tree overthrown by an
elephant, which twenty-three men had attempted in vain.</p>

<p>In the war of Coromandel, in 1751, the gates of the fort
of Ponomaley were attacked by elephants, whose heads had
been covered with iron plates for the purpose.</p>

<p>Among the curious uses to which elephants have been put,
may be mentioned fishing. A hunter came to a pool in the
valley of the Chengree, India, once, with about twenty-five
elephants. The natives discovered that it was alive with
fish; but there were no boats. No one had a line; and, even
if they had, the water was too shallow near shore, and too
deep in the centre. The sportsman solved the difficulty by
mustering all the elephants without their gear: then providing
themselves with spears and baskets, the natives mounted
the elephants, and commanded them to wade in. This they
quickly did, rather enjoying the sport, and soon, by stirring
up the mud, had the finny occupants of the pool flying about
in all directions. Very soon the large fish began to come to
the surface; and the elephants began to chase them, guided
by their mahouts, who struck them with their spears; and,
as soon as one was impaled, it was drawn upon the elephant,
beheaded, and thrown into the basket. According
to the hunter, who invented this curious method of fishing,
the elephants exhibited remarkable sagacity in following the
game, abstaining, at a hint from the mahout, from blowing
under water, as they are apt to do, or splashing, indeed,
acting exactly as if they knew that a noise of any kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
would retard the progress of the sport. Sometimes several
elephants would start after the same fish; and, as the water
was four or five feet deep, the scene would become intensely
exciting, the men standing on the great animals, and literally
using them as boats. Occasionally a man would lose his
balance, and tumble over, to rise, gasping, and half-strangled
by the muddy water which soon dried, and gave them the
appearance of having been white-washed. One elephant
stepped into a deep hole, and nearly turned a somerset,
tossing the men into the water; and, all in all, it was a very
laughable and amusing sight to witness, and withal successful,
as seventy pounds of fish were caught from the fleet of
elephants.</p>

<p>Even after death, the elephant is of more or less value,
exclusive of its ivory. In various countries certain portions,
as the head and tongue, are esteemed as articles of food.
The bones are used in Ceylon in enriching estates. The
hair of the tail is utilized by native goldsmiths in bracelets,
and teeth are well known as ivory. The feet are mounted
as seats and footstools; and the great ears of the African
elephant are harnessed to oxen, and dragged about to convey
merchandise of various kinds. Sir Samuel Baker says that
he has often used the large, soft ear of the African elephant
as a couch after the fatigues of the hunt.</p>

<p>So valuable is the elephant in the East, that the inhabitants
of the country wonder how Americans and others carry on
the ordinary work of life without them; and, when Abraham
Lincoln was president, the King of Siam conceived the idea
of relieving the American people by providing them with
these animals, which were to be raised just as ostriches are
now on the California coast. The facts concerning this offer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
are extremely interesting, and I am indebted to the correspondent
of “The Philadelphia Times” for the following.
The communication is now in the keeping of the United
States Treasury:—</p>

<p>“The letter is kept in a box of polished light-colored wood,
about three inches deep, twelve inches long, and eight inches
in width, gilded inside, and securely locked. The envelope
for the letter is a bag of cloth of gold, long and narrow.
The letter is written upon thick paper, the size of foolscap,
with a broad gold border all around it. It is in Siamese;
and accompanying it, and tied to it with a silken cord, is
what is stated at its head to be a ‘true translation’ of the
letter of the King of Siam. At the top of the first page, in
the upper left-hand corner, is a curious little seal, not larger
than a quarter of a dollar. Its impression is in gilt, and the
device one peculiar to Siam, and unlike any thing else in
nature or art.</p>

<p>“The letter begins with the names, title, and possessions of
the King of Siam, whose personal letter it is supposed to be.
Following this, on the same page, is the following address:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘<i>To His Most Respected Excellent Presidency</i>,—</p>

<p>“‘The President of the United States of America, who,
having been chosen by the citizens of the United States as
most distinguished, was made president and chief magistrate
in the affairs of the nation for an appointed time of office;
viz., Buchanan, Esq., who had forwarded an official letter to
us from Washington, 10th May, Anno Christi 1859, which
was Wednesday, tenth night of waxing moon ... in the
year of Monkey, with a package of books, a hundred and
ninety-two volumes in number, which came to hand in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
year following. Or to whomsoever the people have elected
anew as chief ruler in place of President Buchanan ...
[here some more complimentary titles and allusions are
inserted] sendeth friendly greeting.’</p>

</div>

<p>“The letter goes on to comment upon the difficulties of
sending communications from Siam to the United States, and
to explain the indirect course letters took: so the king congratulated
himself on having found an excellent opportunity—a
sailing vessel of the United-States navy, the ‘John
Adams,’ in command of Capt. Berrien, having come into the
chief port of Siam, and its officers desiring to make a friendly
visit to the king, and having been received by him—to forward
his letter and some complimentary presents—a sword
and a photographic likeness of himself—to the President of
the United States.</p>

<p>“The king mentioned, that, in reply to questions asked by
him of Capt. Berrien, he had learned that there are no elephants
on the continent of America; and that so great a
curiosity are they, that thousands of people will crowd to see
even a large tusk of an elephant when exhibited in some
public place, saying it was a wonderful thing: and he had
learned that elephants are regarded by Americans as the
most remarkable of all the large quadrupeds. He had also
been informed that there were no camels on the continent of
America: the Americans have sought for and purchased
them, some from Europe, some from Arabia; and that now
camels propagate their race, and are serviceable and of benefit
to the country, and are already numerous in America. From
this, one might infer that Capt. Berrien imposed somewhat
on the credulity of this graciously inclined monarch.</p>

<p>“Having heard this about camels, it occurred to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
king, continued the letter, that ‘if on the continent of
America, there should be several pairs of young male and
female elephants turned loose in forests, where there was
abundance of water and grass, in any region called by the
English the torrid zone, and all were forbidden to molest
them, to attempt to raise them would be well; and, if the
climate should prove favorable to elephants, we are of opinion,
that, after a while, they will increase till there be large
herds, as there are on the continent of Asia, until the inhabitants
of America will be able to catch them and tame them,
and use them as beasts of burden, because, on account of the
great strength and size of the elephants, they could be made
to carry very heavy loads, and would be of benefit to the
country, since they can travel where carriage and other roads
have not been made.’</p>

<p>“The king, to illustrate how feasible it is to introduce
elephants, and raise them successfully in countries where
they had been unknown, cites examples from ancient times
of the ‘transplanting of elephants’ to places where there
were none, instancing the island of Ceylon, to which they
were first taken four hundred years ago, and have become
very plentiful there.</p>

<p>“He then proposed to give a number of young elephants
of both sexes to our country if the United States will furnish
a vessel for their transportation, supplied with food enough
for them during the voyage. He further suggested that a
steamer tow the ship on which they travel to America to
hasten their arrival, so that the elephants would be received
in good condition in their new home. He says very positively,
that, as soon as they arrive in America, they must be turned
loose in a jungle in the torrid zone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“The king desires ‘the President of the United States,
and Congress, who conjointly with him rule the country,’ to
let him know their views as soon as possible, as to his offer
to furnish the elephants, and whether or not they are wanted.
He sends with this letter a pair of the largest size of elephants’
tusks, ‘both from the same animal, to be deposited
for public inspection in the United States, that thereby the
glory and renown of Siam may be promoted.’</p>

<p>“This letter, as stated at its close, was ‘given at our royal
audience hall, Anant Samagome, in the Grand Palace,’ etc.,
at Bangkok, Siam, ‘on Thursday, the fifth night of the waxing
moon, in the lunar month from the commencement of
the cold season in the year of Monkey, corresponding to the
solar date of 14th February, Anno Christi 1861, which is the
eleventh year, and this day is the 3,564th day of our reign.’</p>

<p>“It is scarcely necessary to say that this generous offer of
the King of Siam to stock an elephant farm in America, was
in due time declined, with thanks, by the authorities at
Washington. By the time the letter was received, Abraham
Lincoln was President, and Mr. Seward Secretary of State;
and it is said, that, when the latter asked Mr. Lincoln what
should be done with the elephants if they came, Mr. Lincoln
said he did not know, unless ‘they were used to stamp out
the rebellion.’</p>

<p>“It is on the statute-books, however, that the Emperor of
Morocco once presented a lion and two horses to the United
States Consul at Tangier, to be sent to the government at
Washington; and that it was done, and the matter called to
the attention of Congress, whereupon it was</p>

<p>“‘<i>Resolved</i>, By the Senate and House of Representatives in
Congress assembled, That the President of the United States<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
be, and he is hereby, authorized to cause the two horses received
as a present by the Consul of the United States at
Tangier, from the Emperor of Morocco, to be sold in Washington
City, by public auction, on the last Saturday in February,
1835, and to cause the proceeds thereof to be placed
in the Treasury of the United States, and that the lion
received in like manner, be presented to such suitable institution,
person or persons, as the President of the United
States may designate.</p>

<p>“‘Approved Feb. 13, 1835.’”</p>

<span class="smaller">IVORY.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>One of the most valuable, and certainly the most beautiful,
of animal products is the substance we call ivory,
which composes the upper incisor teeth of elephants. From
the very earliest times, it has been esteemed by man, and
has gradually grown more valuable as years have gone by,
until now the demand is so great that the extermination of
the noble animals that produce it is threatened, merely that
we may have knife-handles, billiard-balls, piano-keys, and
many articles of luxury.</p>

<p>The trade in ivory is of great antiquity; and doubtless, in
very early times, there was a far greater demand for it than
at present, and elephants were slaughtered in vast numbers.
But after this, came a cessation; and the great animals had
an opportunity to increase. According to Herodotus, Africa
yielded her tributes of elephant teeth to the kings of Persia.
The people of Judæa built ivory palaces; and even the galleys
of Tyre, according to Pliny, had benches of ivory. In the
Odyssey, we read of the luxury of the early Greek princes,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The spoils of elephants the roofs inlay.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Etruscan attributes of royalty were sceptres and
thrones of ivory, and the ancient kings and magistrates of
Rome sat upon ivory seats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>It is said, that, in the time of Pliny, the supply of African
ivory almost gave out, when, only two centuries earlier, it
was so plentiful, that, according to Polybius, the finest tusks
were used as door-posts on the confines of Ethiopia, and even
for palisades about the fields.</p>

<p>The decay of the ivory trade commenced with the fall of
Rome: no longer were the commonest articles made of ivory,
and even the Roman ivory tablets (<i>libri elephantini</i>) fell into
disuse.</p>

<p>This sudden change was not without its effect; and, at the
beginning of the seventeenth century, elephant tusks were a
drug in the market. According to Battell, “the natives had
their idols of wood in the midst of their towns, fashioned
like a negro: and at the foot thereof was a great heap of
elephants’ teeth, containing three or four tons of them;
these were piled in the earth, and upon them were set the
skulls of dead men, which they had slain in the wars, in
monument of their victory.”</p>

<p>When the Portuguese first established themselves at Angola
and Congo, they found that the natives had accumulated vast
stores of ivory, which was applied to the same
superstitious uses. The Portuguese collected all they could,
and shipped the tusks to Europe, reaping a rich harvest, and
so depleting the supply, that in the middle of the seventeenth
century it was almost exhausted again. In 1840 there were
eleven manufactories of ivory goods in Dieppe, France; and
nearly every large city to-day has one or more such. The
extreme tastes that in the time of Leo X. required ivory
beds, are not gratified in the present day; yet there is a
constant demand for ivory.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to obtain the facts regarding the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
importations of ivory in former years. In eleven years, from
1788 to 1798, 18,914 hundred-weight of ivory were imported
into Great Britain, or about an animal importation of 192,579
pounds. In 1827 about 118,000 pounds were imported.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century the English traded for ivory on
the Guinea coast; and a few years ago, even Cape Town was
a headquarters for quantities of ivory; but the restricted
area of the elephant, results in the tusks being taken to the
nearest shipping-places on the coast, nearer Central Africa.</p>

<p>The natives were often grossly cheated. Mr. Burchell saw
a party of twenty,—men, women, and children,—who had
brought a thousand pounds of ivory to Cape Town, and only
received the simplest articles for it. In the interior he met
a Hottentot who had bought twenty fine tusks of the Bachapins,
at a rate of a sheep for a tusk. These men offered
Mr. Burchell two oxen and two tusks (each too heavy for a
man to carry) for a gun. The native chiefs of to-day have
a better appreciation of the value of ivory, and Europeans
cannot hunt for elephants without making them valuable
presents.</p>

<p>The present demand for ivory comes principally from England,
America, and the European nations; while many tusks,
as the huge teeth are called, are sent to China. In 1885,
which may be considered an average year,—though the
importations differ, and there has been a depression,—439
tons of ivory were imported into England, for which several
million dollars were paid.</p>

<p>By the courtesy of F. Grote &amp; Co. of New York, and
Westendorp &amp; Co., London, I am enabled to present a table
of extreme interest, showing the imports of ivory into Great
Britain for the last forty years. It tells an interesting story<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
of the destruction of the elephant: it is also interesting to
note how the averages differ. The average number of tons
for the years 1845-49 was 294; 1870-74, 627 tons; and for
1880-84, 514 tons; the imports of 1885 showing a falling
off of one hundred tons. The imports by the year are as
follows:—</p>

<p>To produce this enormous amount of ivory, and that imported
into other countries, not less than seventy-five thousand
elephants a year are destroyed. It has been estimated
that fifty-one thousand are killed annually on the western
coast of Africa, and probably twenty-five thousand does not
cover those slaughtered in other localities. Much of this
ivory comes from Africa, about one-fourth being obtained in
India. In 1875-77 the yearly product of the latter country
was between nine thousand and seventeen thousand pounds;
a certain amount of this being cut from the tusks, not necessitating
the death of the animal.</p>

<p>All the tuskers which are taken by Sanderson and others,
in Asia, have their tusks shortened or cut, the tips being valuable
ivory. The end is bound with a brass ring to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
the tusk from splitting: Jumbo’s tusks were cut off in this
way. As the tusk is continually growing, the pulp being
converted into ivory, the trimming operation can be repeated
at certain intervals, generally every eight or ten years.</p>

<p>The finest ivory is that obtained from Equatorial Africa;
either the natives bringing it out, or, as we have seen in
a former chapter, Europeans penetrating the little-known
recesses of the Dark Continent to procure it.</p>

<p>The west-coast ivory, when received, is generally almost
black upon the outside, and presents any thing but an attractive
appearance. The tusks are received by the wholesale
trade, as Westendorp &amp; Co. of London, and Grote &amp; Co. of
New York, the leading ivory-firms, wrapped in raw hides,
sewed up by raw-hide thongs. These outside wraps are
called “Schroons” by the trade. The different ivories have
various tints; and an expert can tell at a glance where a tusk,
or even a small piece of ivory, came from. The ivory which
is shipped at Calcutta has a slight pink hue, and is very fine;
while that received from Egyptian ports is brittle and poor.
A visit to the ivory-vaults of the Messrs. Grote &amp; Co., New
York, would well repay any one interested in the subject of
the economic value of animals. Here all kinds of ivory may
be seen, and the extent and variety of objects made from it
are astonishing. Here we find numbers of rings of ivory
which are awaiting shipment back to Bombay, where they
will be sold as bangles or bracelets to Hindoo women.
Numerous flat ivory slabs are sold to Sheffield, England;
and, finally, we may see them returned in the shape of
knife-handles.</p>

<p>Some of the largest tusks in the Grote vaults are six inches
in diameter at the base; and the tusk at the door of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
this firm, on 14th Street, used as a business sign, is nearly
nine feet in length. This house manufactures almost every
article that ivory can be made into; and objects ranging
from billiard-balls to flat spatulas, for testing flour, may be
seen in their cases. Billiard-balls require the choicest kind
of ivory. The best are made here, and sell at five dollars
each. I believe the Chinese have alone successfully produced
the famous concentric balls of ivory, for which they have
been so long and justly famous. Nothing is wasted in the
ivory-shop. Even the dust is collected, and sold to the New-York
florists, who claim that its results upon roses and other
choice flowers are astonishing. It is also used in tempering
certain steel tools, and in the manufacture of some acids.</p>

<p>To respond to this great demand, many professional ivory-hunters
are constantly in the field. In a single season a
small party have obtained twenty thousand pounds of ivory;
for which they received twenty thousand dollars at Khartoom,
or one dollar per pound. The tusks of elephants differ
much in size; and, to show the loss in wear, Holub states
that the wear on a pair of African tusks in the animal’s lifetime
may equal six pounds,—the ivory being ground down
when the animal uproots trees, and uses them in similar
ways.</p>

<p>In the Abyssinian and Taba regions, tusks rarely exceed
forty pounds, and average only about twenty-five. In Equatorial
Africa they average about forty pounds, and range up
to one hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>Gen. De Lima, returning from Mozambique, brought two
straight tusks for a cross on the high altar of the cathedral
at Goa. One weighed one hundred and eighty pounds, and
the other one hundred and seventy. They had the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
possible curve. “The Friend,” a paper published in Ceylon,
states that the officers of the ships “Quorrah” and “Alburhok,”
engaged in the Niger expedition, were shown two tusks
by a native king which measured two feet and a half in
circumference at the base, were eight feet in length, and
weighed two hundred pounds each. According to Broderip,
a tusk of three hundred and fifty pounds weight was sold at
Amsterdam; but he gives no authority. Tusks often take peculiar
shapes. An elephant was seen, in 1844, in the district
of Bintenne, near Friars-hood Mountain, one of whose tusks
took a complete turn, then resumed its original direction;
and in the museum of the College of Physicians and Surgeons,
there is a spiral tusk. The most remarkable freak of nature
relating to tusks, that I am familiar with, is recorded by
Thomas Baines, F.R.G.S., who was with Livingstone on the
Zambesi. In various chapters, one, two, three, and four
tusked elephants have been referred to; but this giant had
nine. Mr. Baines says that it was shot in 1856; and a Mr.
Edwards, a partner of Chapman, with whom he travelled,
bought six of the tusks. “It had on the right side five, and
on the left four, all growing, as usual, out of the upper jaw.
The pair occupying the usual place were of about thirty
pounds weight each; just behind them projected a pair
somewhat larger, pointing downward and backward; between
these were situated two others, and before and behind
them in the right jaw were two more, but in the left only
one, behind all these, being much smaller.”</p>

<p>The ivory is always sold by weight; and the buyers are
often deceived, as the tusks are liable to contain cavities, or
have the pulp loaded with metal by designing traders. The
size of the tusk generally determines the price; the larger it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
is, the more valuable, those below six or seven pounds being
held at less than half the price per pound than those much
larger. Many tusks are ruined through the ignorance of the
natives. They are generally, however, transported with
great care, the finest being wrapped in wax, or some similar
substance.</p>

<p>Before considering the different kinds of ivory, and the
various uses to which it is put, let us glance at its composition.
In structure, it is equivalent to dentine, the material
of which nearly all teeth are composed, and has an organic
base or matrix, which upon examination is seen to be permeated
by a vast number of very small and delicate canals, each
of about one-fifteenth of an inch in diameter, which seem to
commence at the pulp-cavity, presumably the axis, and extend
outward to the periphery of the tusk. The little canals
are not packed closely together, but are separated by spaces
of about their own diameter. To these tubes, the regularity
of their disposition and their delicacy, the ivory owes its
fineness of grain, and its remarkable elasticity. By examining
them, an expert can distinguish elephant ivory from any
other; as they have a peculiarity of making a series of
decided bends in their course, from the axis to the periphery,
which produces a graining in the ivory, unique and
peculiar.</p>

<p>Ivory is often confused with bone, but is a very different
substance. It is much finer in general structure, much more
elastic, and is without the canals that convey blood-vessels
through the bones. If a section of a tusk is made some distance
from the growing pulp, the centre, or core, will be found
to be darker than the rest, and of a different nature. This
is the remains of the pulp. The outer portion of the tusk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
is still different, or composed of a compact layer of cementum
that covers or encloses the entire tusk. The intermediate
substance is ivory, which shows many circular lines about
the central dark spot, calling to mind the growth-marks seen
in sections of trees, and due to the fact that in all ivory there
are great numbers of very minute spaces known as “interglobular
spaces.” The localities occupied by these spaces
are characterized by a smaller proportion of lime-salts and a
greater proportion of organic matter than other portions.
Hence this part of the ivory is not so dense as the rest, and
is more liable to decomposition: so, in many of the fossil
tusks that are found, a sectional view often shows it separated
into six or seven distinct rings, the intermediate organic
matter having disappeared. It is supposed, that, in living
ivory, these interglobular spaces are filled with some organic
substance. According to Von Bibra, ivory contains from
forty to forty-three per cent of organic matter; while human
dentine contains from twenty-four to thirty-four per cent.</p>

<p>From its delicate structure, ivory takes a rich polish; and
it is also susceptible of being dyed. The ease with which it
is carved, makes it one of the most valuable of all materials
for artistic carving.</p>

<p>The ivory used in England and America is mostly from
the African elephant; but in Russia much of it comes from the
tusks of mammoths, described in chapter fourth. These elephantine
monsters existed in great numbers in former days;
and in some localities, their tusks are found in great abundance.
When the first explorers examined the New Siberian
Islands, they found mammoth tusks projecting from the sand
in many places; and in others the tundra seemed to be fairly
made up of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>The best localities are at the mouth of the Lena and other
Arctic rivers and the Liakhoff and New Siberian Islands.</p>

<p>The mammoth tusks are much more curved than those of
existing elephants, and much heavier, weighing as much as
three hundred and twenty pounds a pair. Some are preserved
as perfectly as if the animal had but recently died,
while many more are ruined by the weather; but to-day,
even after years of collecting, the supply may be said to not
only equal the demand, but to be practically inexhaustible.</p>

<p>As a rule, the mammoth ivory is too dry and brittle for
fine work, and is said to turn yellow. Fine tusks bring large
prices. One recently offered to the Oxford Museum was
valued at five hundred dollars; and about ten years ago, over
one thousand were sent to London for sale, weighing from
one hundred and forty to one hundred and sixty pounds
each. The best of these found a ready market; but, as a
rule, mammoth ivory is not esteemed.</p>

<p>Westendorp has investigated this ivory, and finds that
about fourteen per cent is good; seventeen per cent could be
used in some way; fifty-four was bad; and fifteen per cent
utterly useless. He considered about 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per pound a fair
price.</p>

<p>The life of the ivory-hunter of the North is equally as
dangerous as that of the South, as the tusks, as a rule, are
found only in the most desolate places; yet there is an element
of excitement about it far greater than that which is
experienced in shooting the African elephant. It is true that
the great mammoth is dead; but yet the possibility of finding
the carcass of one of these monsters in the flesh, and
clothed with hair, has been sufficient incentive to keep many
hunters in the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>In the chapter on the mammoth, some of the most remarkable
discoveries have been referred to. The ivory-hunters
have for years found vast quantities of tusks at the New
Siberian Islands, which lie to the north and east of the Lena
delta.</p>

<p>The first mammoth tusk was brought to England by Josias
Logan in 1611, and was obtained in the region of the Petchora.
It is estimated that about one hundred pairs are yearly offered
for sale; and, according to Nordenskiöld, the tusks of at least
twenty thousand mammoths have been collected since Siberia
was first investigated.</p>

<p>The frozen bodies of the mammoth were originally called
mummies; and the first one that is mentioned is in a sketch
of the journey of the Russian ambassador, Evert Yssbrants
Ides, who, in 1692, journeyed through Siberia to China. A
professional ivory-hunter travelled with him, and described
the parts of a specimen which he found; and, to show how
perfectly it was preserved, the neck was still colored by blood.</p>

<p>This same collector found a pair of tusks which weighed
two hundred kilograms. He informed Ides that the heathen
Yakuts, Tunguses, and Ostyaks believed that the mammoth
lived underground, just as did the Chinese; and that it died
only when it came to the surface, and saw or smelled air.</p>

<p>An interesting account of the folk-lore of the natives,
relating to this point, will be found in J. B. Müller’s work
referred to in the bibliography.</p>

<p>In 1839 a complete mammoth was uncovered by a landslide
on the shores of a lake near the Yenisej River.</p>

<p>Nordenskiöld says, “Under the guidance of natives, I collected,
in 1876, at the confluence of the river Mesenkin with
the Yenisej, in 71° 28´ north latitude, some fragments of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
bones, and pieces of the hide, of a mammoth. The hide was
twenty to twenty-five millimetres thick, and nearly tanned
by age, which ought not to appear wonderful, when we consider,
that, though the mammoth lived in one of the latest
periods of the history of our globe, hundreds of thousands,
perhaps millions, of years have, however, passed since the
animal died, to which these pieces of skin once belonged. It
was clear that they had been washed by the neighboring river
Mesenkin out of the tundra-bank; but I endeavored, without
success, to discover the original locality, which was probably
already concealed by river-mud. In the neighborhood was
found a very fine cranium of the musk-ox.”</p>

<p>African-elephant ivory, which is esteemed above all others,
on account of its close grain, and less tendency to turn
yellow when exposed, is semi-transparent when first cut, and
in this condition is called “green” by the ivory-workers. As
it dries, it becomes lighter, and more opaque, owing to the
drying out of the water. During this process, the ivory
shrinks more or less, as wood does; and in making box-covers,
billiard-balls, and in all delicate work, great care is
required, the ivory being generally roughly shaped, and
placed in a warm room to gradually shrink and dry true.
The plates used on piano-keys are dried and shrunk at once
by being baked in an oven.</p>

<p>The greatest skill of the worker is, perhaps, shown in the
original cutting, as here much waste can be made by ignorance
or carelessness. Often the cutter finds cavities in the
ivory, and not uncommonly bullets, and parts of various
weapons. These have been shot into the tender pith at the
base of the tusk, and, in time, become incorporated in the
ivory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>A specimen of a tusk in the Odontological Society, London,
shows a spear-head embedded in the ivory, completely
enclosed by it and secondary dentine, though measuring
seven and a half by ten inches. In another instance, the
tusk was formed into a cup, while the embedded spear-head
was left exposed as a stand. A javelin firmly embedded in
ivory is exhibited in the collection of the College of Physicians
and Surgeons, London.</p>

<p>Ivory is easily worked; and veneers have been cut, according
to Tomes, by a reciprocating saw making a spiral shaving
around the tusk forty feet in length, and twelve inches in
width.</p>

<p>As ivory grows old, it turns yellow, especially if kept in
the dark. It is said that the ancients possessed the secret
of softening it. If this is so, it is one of the lost arts, as it
cannot be done to-day; though it is rendered more flexible
by submitting it to the solvent action of phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>The uses to which ivory is put are innumerable. Formerly
it was used in the manufacture of false teeth, and
it is used to some extent to-day by native dentists in
India. The dust and chips of ivory are all used, and
are either boiled down into a gelatine, or calcined into
ivory-black.</p>

<p>The confectioners are said to use ivory-dust as a basis for
groups, and it is often utilized when a delicate size is required.
The calcined ivory affords a fine black pigment
called ivory-black, and is also used as fine printing-ink,
and in printing etchings and engravings.</p>

<p>All the objects manufactured at Dieppe to-day can, perhaps,
trace back many of their methods to Demosthenes, the
father of the orator, who was a worker in ivory. He had an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
extensive manufactory of cabinet-ware, and used great quantities
of ivory. He had another manufactory, where ivory
knife-handles were made, and was also a wholesale dealer in
the commodity.</p>

<p class="tb">We are indebted to Messrs. F. Grote &amp; Co. for the following
interesting item, which was received too late for insertion
in the proper place:—</p>

<p>“The tusk which stands at our door, in 14th Street, New
York, was brought from Zanzibar, Africa, being from the
species <i>Elephas Africanus</i>. Its length, on the outside curve,
is eight feet and eleven inches; its length on the inside
curve is eight feet and one half inch; its diameter at base
is six and one half inches; its weight is one hundred and
eighty-four pounds.”</p>

<p>This is a notable example, and one which has long excited
public interest.</p>

<p>We are also indebted to Messrs. Totans &amp; Schmidt, of
Fulton Street, New-York City, for the dimensions of a pair
of tusks of an African elephant, which have long graced
their show-window. They measure respectively, eight feet
and six inches, and eight feet four inches, in length. The
larger weighs one hundred and thirty-five pounds, and its
circumference is twenty inches and three quarters at base.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ELEPHANT IN THE ARTS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The elephant has figured prominently in the arts from
the earliest times. The first artist in ivory was undoubtedly
contemporaneous with the mammoth; as upon a
piece of mammoth’s tusk, taken from a cave in France, there
is a rude but quite correct representation of one of these
huge animals: and the figure of the elephant seems to have
been a favorite with the sculptors of all times. On the island
of Elephanta, there are the remains of an ancient statue of an
elephant. A fine cutting of an Indian species with young
was found upon the walls of Pompeii; and the animal is
often seen on the bas-reliefs along the Nile (<a href="#plate22">Plate XXII</a>).</p>

<p>It is upon medals, however, that the elephant figured most
prominently, these now valued relics having been struck off
in honor of the ancient kings and queens to commemorate
their deeds of valor. An interesting medal (<a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.</a>, Fig.
1) was struck in honor of Tranquillina, the wife of Gordian;
the Romans at this time, in a spirit of poetical exaggeration,
choosing the elephant as a symbol of eternity. The legend
“Æternitas Aug.” is expressive of a wish that the emperor
shall live as long as an elephant, which was then believed to
be three or four hundred years.</p>

<p>The sagacity of the elephant is often referred to in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
ancient mythology of the Hindoos; and Ganessa, the god of
wisdom, is represented in the temples of India with a human
body and an elephant’s head: curiously enough, several
ancient medals show the head of Socrates united with that
of an elephant in connection with two other heads. <a href="#plate21">Plate
XXI.</a>, Fig. 2, is explained by Chifletius as referring to the
trial of Socrates; and the two heads are supposed to be
those of Anytus and Melitus, his accusers. This, however,
has been questioned. A Neapolitan medal (<a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.</a>,
Fig. 3), supposed to be antique, represents an elephant
standing before the tripod of Apollo, upon which the sacrificial
fire is burning. Medals are in existence in Europe,
showing the pretended religion of the elephant. Such a one
was struck by Cardinal Zabrella (<a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.</a>, Fig. 4), and
shows one of these animals worshipping the moon.</p>

<p>In the “Museum Cuspinianum,” edited by Laurentius,
there is figured a medal (<a href="#plate22">Plate XXII.</a>, Fig. 5) which is supposed
to represent Alexander after his conquest in Persia,
entering through the gate of a city, or a triumphal arch, in
a chariot drawn by four elephants. On the other side of the
medal, the head of Alexander is shown, with Neptune on
one side of his helmet. Some experts consider this medal
as spurious.</p>

<p>Alexander figures on many medals, and a very fine one
(<a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.</a>, Fig. 6) represents his head covered with an
elephant’s skin. On the reverse is Minerva, armed with a
helmet, shield, and spear; and before her an eagle holding
lightning in his talons. Berger supposes it to refer to the
defeat of the elephants of Porus.</p>

<p>Quite similar in general appearance to this is a medal
(<a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.</a>, Fig. 7) supposed to represent Ptolemy Philadelphus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
The head of an elephant, or the skin of the head,
is used as a head-covering, the tusks extending over the head
as in a Roman medallion of Africa (<a href="#plate22">Plate XXII.</a>, Fig. 9).</p>

<p>The last record of the elephant in Syria is found upon a
coin (<a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.</a>, Fig. 8) struck in honor of Antiochus, who
was raised to the throne in the two hundred and twenty-fifth
year of the era of the Seleucidæ, 87 B.C. The elephant is
represented as bearing a torch, according to the custom of
the Syrian monarchs, with the horn of plenty behind him.
Julius Cæsar had many medals struck off in his honor. One
(<a href="#plate22">Plate XXII.</a>, Fig. 10) represents his head, the reverse being a
triumphal chariot drawn by four elephants, and is supposed
by experts to relate to the conquest of Juba and the Mauri
in Africa. Another medal, which was struck by the Emperor
Trajan (<a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.</a>, Fig. 11), in honor of Julius
Cæsar, represents an elephant trampling upon a serpent,
probably relating to the same event.</p>

<p>The Emperor Augustus was voted by the senate a triumphal
arch, a chariot drawn by two elephants, and a statue,
for the great deeds he accomplished; all of which is recorded
on a medal (<a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.</a>, Fig. 12). After the death of Augustus,
his statue was conveyed on a chariot by four elephants
to the circus, after which the games commenced, this post-funereal
honor being also commemorated by a medal. Caligula
was also thus honored by the senate; and a medal (<a href="#plate21">Plate
XXI.</a>, Fig. 13) pictures him sitting upon the chariot, as a
god surrounded by stars. Nero and his mother, Agrippina,
are represented (<a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.</a>, Fig. 14) in a somewhat similar
position.</p>

<p>The inventive genius of Severus in suggesting new pleasures
was commemorated in a medal (<a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.</a>, Fig. 15)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
which represents numerous animals, including the elephant,
about a ship which, loaded with ferocious animals, he sailed
on a small lake for the diversion of his favorites.</p>

<p>One of the finest elephant medals extant represents the
statue of Pertinax drawn by four elephants in a triumphal
chariot after his death (<a href="#plate22">Plate XXII.</a>, Fig. 16); and these are
but a few that are to be found in collections in various parts
of the world, but show that the elephant took an important
part in all the deeds of the great men of the time.</p>

<p>The ivory of elephants has been employed in artistic work
since very early times. The British Museum has specimens
of ivory plaques of rich design taken from Nineveh, which
are supposed to date from 900 B.C. The execution in some
is very fine; many figures being in high, and some in low, relief,
but all showing that the worker was an expert in the art.</p>

<p>“Traces of gilding,” says Tomes, “remain on many of
them; and they were often, furthermore, enriched by being
inlaid with fragments of <i>lapis lazuli</i>, or of a colored glass in
apparent imitation of this: the edges of the larger heads
were generally rendered conspicuous by this means. In one
of the panels, the border of the dresses, the thrones on which
the figures were seated, the ornaments above the cartouche,
and the cymbals upon the cartouche itself, were thus inlaid
with color. The largest object is a carved staff, perhaps a
sceptre. Amongst the smaller pieces are heads of animals,
and entire animals, griffins, human heads, crossed and clasped
hands, rings, etc. Like the ivory-carvers of a later period,
these early workers seem to have studied the economy of
their material. Thus, a beautiful carving in high relief of
two griffins, standing upon papyrus flowers, has been worked
in the interior segment of a large tusk, the natural curvature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
of which it follows.” Besides these discovered at Nineveh,
some other ivories of great antiquity exist; and ivory-workers
are mentioned as a distinct class of artificers at the commencement
of the Christian era. Many writing-tablets of
ivory, with raised rims inside, where wax was spread over
their surfaces, have come down to us. These were often
made to fold together, and the exterior richly ornamented
with carvings. It was the custom for newly appointed
consuls under the empire to send these plaques to persons
of importance, and the covers sometimes have portrayed
upon them the consul in his robes of office.</p>

<p>These ancient relics are invaluable. In the South Kensington
Museum, there is exhibited a beautiful ivory plaque of
the third century, for which two thousand dollars were paid.
It forms one-half of a diptych, and measures eleven and
three-quarters by four and three-quarters inches. The other
half is in the Hotel Cluny.</p>

<p>Many of the ancient carvings deal with sacred subjects.
One of the most beautiful is a Pieta, representing the Virgin
holding the dead Christ in her lap, and dates from the fourteenth
century. Schliemann, in his excavations on the supposed
site of Troy, has found many ivory objects, as pins,
buckles, etc.</p>

<p>The most profligate and, it must be confessed, magnificent
use of ivory is seen in the attempts of the early Greeks to
add to the splendors of their national religion. During the
time of Pericles, 445 B.C., there was a demand for fine statues
of the gods; and it was reserved for Phidias, the most
famous of all the ancient sculptors, to invent the ivory
statue,—not the diminutive creations with which we are
familiar, but colossal figures formed of an aggregation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
small pieces. The Greeks had figures of wood and stone;
but finally the public taste seemed to demand something
more refined, and the combination of gold and ivory was the
result. (<a href="#plate17">See Plate XVII.</a>)</p>

<p>The use of ivory in art-work had preceded this many
years. From the time of the Trojan war, they had used
ivory arms and furniture; and two hundred years later we
hear of Solomon introducing it in Judæa. “Once in three
years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold and silver,
ivory, and apes and peacocks;” and being thus supplied with
the elephants’ teeth of India, “the king made a great throne
of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.” One hundred
years after Solomon, the sacred historian speaks of “the
ivory house of King Ahab” as so wonderful, that it is
enumerated in Chronicles with all the cities that he built.
“The ivory house of Ahab,” and “the ivory palaces” of the
forty-fifth psalm, no doubt referred to buildings profusely
ornamented with ivory.</p>

<p>Phidias, then, must have been familiar with ivory-work,
having such illustrious examples in history; but none of his
predecessors had attempted the stupendous works which
rendered him famous. Unfortunately the creations of this
celebrated artist were all destroyed, and we have only the
descriptions left.</p>

<p>When Greece fell, her oppressors, the Turks, a race of
barbarians, destroyed all the grand works in marble they
could find. For two or three hundred years, they pounded
up the beautiful statues of the Parthenon to obtain lime to
make their miserable hovels; and it is probably to them that
is due the destruction of the works of chryselephantine
(gold and ivory) statuary that were so celebrated, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
almost every ancient writer described them. One was so
richly ornamented with gold, that Pericles mentions it as
one of the resources for carrying on the Peloponnesian war.
The gold was stolen, and carried off by Leochares during the
siege of Athens by Demetrius.</p>

<p>The masterpiece of Phidias was the Jupiter of Olympia.
“The god,” says Pausanias, “made of gold and ivory, is
seated upon a throne. On his head is a crown, representing
an olive-branch. In his right hand he carries a Victory, also
of gold and ivory, holding a wreath, and having a crown
upon her head. In the left hand of the god is a sceptre,
shining with all sorts of metals. The bird placed upon the
summit of the sceptre is an eagle. The sandals of the god
are of gold, and his mantle is also golden. The figures of
various animals, and of all sorts of flowers, particularly
lilies, are painted upon it. The throne is a diversified assemblage
of gold, of precious stones, of ivory, and of ebony, in
which figures of all kinds are also painted or sculptured.”</p>

<p>Curiously enough, this writer does not give the dimensions
of the work, an omission that is supplied by Strabo.
“Phidias,” he says, “had made his Jupiter sitting, and
touching almost the summit of the roof of the temple: so
that it appeared, that, if the god had risen up, he would have
lifted off the roof. The interior of the temple is said to
have been sixty feet high, and the statue was about forty-eight
feet in height.” Equalling if not rivalling Phidias in
the estimation of some, was Polycletus, who produced the
Juno of Argos. His works were not on so grand a scale as
his contemporary Phidias, but excelled them in beauty and
execution. Pausanias thus describes his masterpiece: “The
statue of Juno is seated on a throne. Her size is extraordinary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
She is of gold and ivory. On her head is a crown,
whereon are worked the figures of the Hours and Graces.
In one hand she holds the sceptre, in the other the fruit of
the pomegranate.” Maximus Tyrius says, “Polycletus enabled
the Argives to contemplate the queen of the gods in
all her majesty. She is seated upon a throne of gold, where
we admire the whiteness of her breast and arms of ivory.”</p>

<p>The Minerva of the Parthenon, a gold and ivory statue,
was a marvellous piece of work, and one of the earliest productions
of Phidias. There is no known description of it,
though frequent allusions to it are found in the works of
ancient writers. From Plato, we learn that the gold on the
statue predominated over the ivory. “Phidias,” he says,
“made neither the eyes, nor the face, nor the feet, nor the
hands, of his Minerva of gold, but of ivory;” and Plutarch
records the fact that Phidias arranged to meet his critics, by
so disposing the gold about the statue that it could be taken
off and weighed, if his honesty was doubted.</p>

<p>After the death of Alexander, statues of himself and family,
in gold and ivory, were placed in the Philippeum of
Olympia. The funeral monument of Hephæstion was ornamented
with statues of ivory and gold.</p>

<p>The successors of Alexander made lavish use of ivory.
Ptolemy Philadelphus, at the time of his triumph in Egypt,
was followed by six hundred elephants’ tusks borne by
slaves; and, according to Quatremère de Quincy, some of
the many statues drawn upon the cars in his triumphal
march were of gold and ivory.</p>

<p>To show the abundance of ivory at this time, Ptolemy
used it to build a portico in his favorite ship, described by
Athenæus.</p>

<p>According to Dion Cassius, Cæsar caused a statue of himself
to be executed in ivory; and Passiteles, a contemporary
of Pompey, executed an ivory statue of Jupiter for the temple
built by Metellus. The doors of the Palatium, which
Augustus raised after the victory of Actium, were of ivory.
A similar statue was decreed to Germanicus by the senate,
and the Emperor Titus had an equestrian statue executed in
honor of Britannicus.</p>

<p>Colossal statues of ivory continued in favor under the
Romans, and Phidias had many followers: thus Adrian had
completed the temple of Jupiter at Athens; he erected in it
a large statue of gold and ivory.</p>

<p>These grand works fell into disuse when Christianity was
established under Constantine, and probably many of these
works of art were destroyed at this time. All that remain
of the vast numbers of ivory statues is a figure about eight
inches in height, and the works referred to on previous pages.</p>

<p>At the present day, ivory sculpture is confined to small
figures of various kinds, the most extensive work being done
by the Chinese and Japanese artists: the latter delight in the
grotesque productions of their art.</p>

<p>According to the Davenport Academy of Sciences, to
which I am indebted for permission to use the accompanying
engravings, the mastodon figured in the arts of the mound-builders.
The pipes shown in <a href="#plate18">Plate XVIII.</a> presumably
represent a proboscidian; and many notable archæologists
believe that the pipe-makers were familiar with the mastodon,
and perpetuated its form in the pipes. According to
Mr. Charles E. Putnam, president of the Academy, one of
the pipes was found, in 1880, in a mound on the farm of Mr.
P. Hass, in Louisa County, Io., the discoverer being the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
Rev. A. Blumer, a Lutheran clergyman, who presented the
pipe to the Academy. The other pipe was obtained by
Rev. J. Goss from a farmer in the same county, who found
it while planting corn on his farm some time previous. The
famous big elephant mound in Grant County, Wis., is
supposed to represent an elephant in profile, the huge, pillar-like
legs and the trunk being plainly seen; though it might
well have been intended to represent any other animal of
like shape.</p>

<span class="smaller">ELEPHANTS IN THE AMPHITHEATRE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>As the elephant was used in the early days to add to the
pomp and glory of the Roman conquerors, it is not surprising
that they were also employed in the games and sports
of the people. It was the custom in the days of old Rome,
to match men against the most ferocious animals; and, long
before the elephant was known in Italy, brave men met the
lion, single-handed, in the arena. When the elephant was introduced,
it was evident that the amphitheatre had new possibilities;
and forthwith the huge animals became a feature
of the barbaric pastimes of the period. It is needless to say
that a people given to such diversions, which involved the
torture of thousands of living creatures, were grossly debased
morally.</p>

<p>Milton has thus described the times and men under
Tiberius:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That people, victor once, now vile and base,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And from the daily scene effeminate.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For four hundred years Rome was given over to displays,
in which the most brutal passions were aroused, and of
which the Spanish bull-fight is the sole modern representative.
The great circus where these exhibitions took place
was the Colosseum, in which five thousand wild beasts were
slaughtered at its dedication by Vespasian; and its skeleton-walls
still stand to-day, a monument to the skill and misdirected
talent of the people of that time.</p>

<p>The Roman circus was thoroughly a government institution,
and a part of the political machinery of the time in
this way, that the exhibitions of strange wild beasts was
devised by the victorious Roman rulers to show to their constituents
and countrymen the wonders of the foreign countries
they had conquered.</p>

<p>According to Pliny, Mutius Scævola (102 B.C.) first exhibited a
combat of lions at the circus, and C. Scipio Trasica
and C. Lentulus were the originators of contests between
men and wild beasts.</p>

<p>In these terrific struggles, lions and tigers were let loose
in the arena, and fought with human slaves and convicts.</p>

<p>When Pompey dedicated his theatre, he gave the most
remarkable exhibition on record. Five hundred lions and
eighteen hundred elephants are said to have been pitted
against a body of armed men. The huge animals were attacked in
every possible way,—sometimes by swords, again
by lances. In the second consulate of Pompey (54 B.C.), a
herd was matched against a company of Getulian archers;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
and, according to Pliny, one of the elephants, enraged by
its wounds, rushed upon an archer, and hurled his shield
high in air. Another, wounded by a javelin, created a panic
among the rest; the great animals rushing against the railing
of the circus with such force, that it gave way, and numbers
of the spectators were wounded.</p>

<p>As a rule, the elephants were defeated; and the historian
Dion adds a description of a wonder no less honorable to
the Roman people than to the sagacity of the elephants.
“The spectators,” he says, “so compassionated the animals,
when they saw them raising their trunks to heaven, roaring
most piteously, as if imploring the gods to avenge the cruel
treachery which had compelled them to come from their native
forests, that they demanded that they should be saved.”
Pliny, relating the same story, states that the populace were
so touched by the terror which the elephants exhibited, and
so full of admiration at their sagacity, that regardless of the
presence of Pompey, and forgetful of his munificence, they
rose from their seats, and demanded, with imprecations
against the consul, that the combat should be at an end.
But habit appears soon to have reconciled the people to the
torturing cruelties of the amphitheatre,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Where murder breathed her bloody steam;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and we have few other recorded instances of their clemency.</p>

<p>The elephant tournaments of Cæsar added greatly to his
popularity as dictator. “When Cæsar, the conqueror of the
world,” says Velleius Paterculus, “returned to the city, he
forgave all who had borne arms against him [which passes
all human belief], and exhibited ship-fights, and contests of
horse and foot, together with elephants.” “On this occasion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
the spectators were well secured by ditches, which surrounded
the arena, from the charges of the infuriated beasts, who had
annoyed them considerably at the games of Pompey. In
these sports of the great dictator, twenty elephants were
opposed to five hundred men on foot.”</p>

<p>Entertainments of this kind naturally tended to debase
and brutalize the people, and the demand for slaughter was
ever on the increase. It is said that Claudius rose at daylight
to go to the circus, that he might not miss a single pang
of the victims, human or brute. During his reign, and that
of Nero, a famous sport was to match an elephant against a
single fencer, who sometimes attacked the great beast on
horseback, and again on foot.</p>

<p>The Colosseum was the natural outcome of the passion for
such barbarous sports. The old one did not afford room
enough, and Vespasian commenced the new one, which was
completed by Titus (A.D. 79); and it still stands, as a
monument of a dark era in the history of Rome.</p>

<p>While these exhibitions would seem only a remnant of the
most barbarous ages, they have been permitted, even at the
present day. In certain parts of India, elephants are now
baited to afford entertainment to certain native princes and
nobles; and fifty or sixty years ago it was very common.</p>

<p>When Bishop Heber was at the court of Baroda, “The
Rájah,” he says, “was anxious to know whether I had observed
his rhinoceros and his hunting-tigers, and offered to
show me a day’s sport with the last, or to bait an elephant
for me,—a cruel amusement which is here not uncommon....
I do not think he understood my motive for declining to
be present.”</p>

<p>“At the palace of Jyepoor,” says the same writer, “we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
were shown five or six elephants in training for a fight. Each
was separately kept in a small, paved court, with a little
litter, but very dirty. They were all what is called ‘must;’
that is, fed on stimulating substances, to make them furious:
and all showed in their eyes, their gaping mouths, and the
constant motion of their trunks, signs of fever and restlessness.
Their mahouts seemed to approach them with great
caution; and, on hearing a step, they turned round as far as
their chains would allow, and lashed fiercely with their
trunks.”</p>

<p>Mr. Crawford states that elephant combats were common
in his day; but, as a rule, the animals, directed by mahouts,
fought across a stout railing, the method of attack being to
butt each other, and cut with the tusks.</p>

<p>Father Tachard, a French Jesuit, witnessed an elephant-fight
in Siam, in 1685, before the king. The animals were
matched against each other, but were securely tied by the
hind-legs, so they could not severely injure each other. They
fenced with their tusks, striking such powerful blows that
one of the combatants lost its tusks.</p>

<p>Elephant-fights have been a favorite amusement in India
from the very earliest times. At Agra, according to the
“Ayeen Akbery,” the emperor built a large amphitheatre
especially for these performances; and Robert Covert, who
travelled in Hindostan in 1609, in referring to Agra, tells
of elephants fighting before the Mogul, parted with rockets
of wild-fire, made round, like hoops, which they thrust in
their faces.</p>

<p>The finest account extant of one of these combats is given
by Bernier:—</p>

<p>“The festivals generally conclude with an amusement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
unknown in Europe,—a combat between two elephants,
which takes place in the presence of all the people, on the
sandy space near the river; the king, the principal ladies of
the court, and the omrahs, viewing the spectacle from different
apartments in the fortress.</p>

<p>“A wall of earth is raised three or four French feet wide,
and five or six high. The two ponderous beasts meet one
another face to face, on opposite sides of the wall, each having
a couple of riders, that the place of the man who sits on
the shoulders, for the purpose of guiding the elephant with
a large iron hook, may immediately be supplied if he should
be thrown down. The riders animate the elephants, either
by soothing words, or by chiding them as cowards, and urge
them on with their heels, until the poor creatures approach
the wall, and are brought to the attack. The shock is tremendous;
and it appears surprising that they even survive
the fearful wounds and blows inflicted with their teeth, their
heads, and their trunks. There are frequent pauses during
the fight; it is suspended and renewed; and the mud wall
being at length thrown down, the stronger or more courageous
elephant passes on, attacks his opponent, and, putting
him to flight, pursues and fastens upon him so obstinately,
that the animals can be separated only by means of cherkys,
or fireworks, which are made to explode between them; for
they are naturally timid, and have a particular dread of fire,
which is the reason why elephants have been used with so
very little advantage in armies since the use of fire-arms.
The boldest come from Ceylon; but none are employed in
war which have not been regularly trained, and accustomed
for years to the discharge of muskets close to their heads,
and the bursting of crackers between their legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>“The fight of these noble animals is attended with much
cruelty. It frequently happens that some of the riders are
trodden under foot, and killed on the spot; the elephant having
always cunning enough to feel the importance of dismounting
the rider of his adversary, whom he therefore
endeavors to strike down with his trunk. So imminent is
the danger considered, that, on the day of combat, the unhappy
men take the same formal leave of their wives and
children as if condemned to death. They are somewhat
consoled by the reflection, that, if their lives should be preserved,
and the king be pleased with their conduct, not only
will their pay be augmented, but a sack of peyssas (equal to
fifty francs) will be presented to them the moment they
alight from the elephant. They have also the satisfaction of
knowing, that, in the event of their death, the pay will be
continued to the widows, and that their sons will be appointed
to the same situation. The mischief with which this
amusement is attended does not always terminate with the
death of the rider: it often happens that some of the spectators
are knocked down and trampled upon by the elephants,
or by the crowd; for the rush is terrible when, to avoid the
infuriated combatants, men and horses, in confusion, take to
flight. The second time I witnessed this exhibition, I owed
my safety entirely to the goodness of my horse and the
exertions of my two servants.”</p>

<p>In the middle of the seventeenth century, elephant-fighting
was a favorite amusement among the princes of the Mogul
empire. Almost every day some exhibition was given,
devised to afford a display of the greatest cruelty. A single
elephant was matched against six horses, which were killed
by being clasped about the neck by the elephant, and suffocated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
or impaled by their tusks. On other occasions, the
elephant was matched against a tiger. Mr. Crawford witnessed
such a performance. The tiger was muzzled, and its
claws cut, and was finally killed by successive tosses from
the tusks of the infuriated elephant, who hurled the helpless
animal a distance of thirty feet.</p>

<p>At one of the Mogul entertainments, an English bull-dog
was matched against an elephant. The pugnacious animal
seized the trunk of the elephant, and clung to it until it was
jerked into the air to a great height. But it held on so long,
that bull-dogs became great favorites with the Mogul, who
had them carried about in palanquins with him, and is said
to have fed them himself with silver tongs, made expressly
for the purpose. Pliny gives an account of two remarkable
dogs, which were presented to Alexander the Great by the
King of Albania, one of which vanquished an elephant.
Happily, the day for these barbarous contests has gone by,
at least in civilized nations.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ELEPHANT IN PAGEANTRY.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In all the magnificent ceremonials and pageants of the
Orient, the elephant forms a prominent feature: and
even to-day we are delighted and amused with the impressive
spectacle a herd presents as it marches in the procession of
the circus; the dignified bearing of the animals,
their measured tread, and large stature, all adding to the
grandeur of the scene.</p>

<p>That this was recognized in olden times, is well known;
and, whenever a king desired to show his power and riches to
the best advantage, the elephant was employed. Bernier
has given a vivid description of some of the processions of
the East.</p>

<p>“I cannot avoid,” he says, “dwelling on this pompous procession
of the seraglio. It strongly arrested my attention
during the late march, and I feel delight in recalling it to
my memory. Stretch imagination to its utmost limits, and
you can conceive no exhibition more grand and imposing
than when Rochinara Begum (Aurengzebe’s sister), mounted
on a stupendous Pegu elephant, and seated in a mik-dember,
blazing with gold and azure, is followed by five or
six other elephants, with mik-dembers nearly as resplendent
as her own, and filled with ladies attached to her household.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
Close to the princess are the chief eunuchs, richly adorned
and finely mounted, each with a cane in his hand; and, surrounding
her elephant, a troop of female servants from Tartary
and Kashmire, fantastically attired, and riding handsome
pad-horses. Besides these attendants, are several eunuchs
on horseback, accompanied by a multitude of pagys, or
lackeys, on foot, with large canes, who advance a great way
before the princess, both to the right and to the left, for the
purpose of clearing the road, and driving before them every
intruder. Immediately behind Rochinara Begum’s retinue
appears a principal lady of the court, mounted and attended
much in the same manner as the princess. This lady is followed
by a third; she by a fourth; and so on, until fifteen
or sixteen females of quality pass, with a grandeur of appearance,
equipage, and retinue, more or less proportionate to
their rank, pay, and office. There is something very impressive
of state and royalty in the march of these sixty or more
elephants; in their solemn and, as it were, measured steps;
in the splendor of their mik-dembers, and the brilliant and
innumerable followers in attendance. And if I had not regarded
this display of magnificence with a sort of philosophical
indifference, I should have been apt to be carried away
by the similar flights of imagination as inspire most of the
Indian poets, when they represent the elephants as carrying
so many goddesses, concealed from the vulgar gaze.”</p>

<p>For many years after the capture of India by the British,
elephants were employed by the princes and nobles; but
now their use is prohibited in Calcutta, on account of the
many accidents that resulted; and in British India the animal
is rarely seen on occasions of ceremony, except at the
courts of native princes who still have some authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>Elephants were employed in the ceremonies of the Juggernaut;
five elephants preceding the car containing the idol,
“bearing towering flags, dressed in crimson caparisons, and
having bells hanging to their caparisons.”</p>

<p>At the time when the two sons of Tippoo were received
as hostages by Lord Cornwallis, they approached his lordship
mounted on a richly ornamented elephant, and seated in a
silver howdah.</p>

<p>According to a contemporaneous writer, at the Vizier
Ally’s wedding, 1795, “The procession was grand beyond
conception. It consisted of about twelve hundred elephants,
richly caparisoned, drawn up in a regular line, like a regiment
of soldiers. About one hundred elephants in the centre
had howdahs, or castles, covered with silver: in the midst of
these appeared the nabob, mounted on an uncommonly large
elephant, within a howdah covered with gold, richly set with
precious stones.”</p>

<p>The Moguls were particularly fond of parade and display,
and daily they had an elephant dress-parade; all their finest
elephants being marched before them, harnessed in the most
magnificent manner.</p>

<p>The elephant-parades at the court of Aurengzebe have
been described by Bernier, and those of the court of Jehanghir
by Sir Thomas Rowe. The latter says, “His greatest
elephants were brought before him, some of which, being
lord elephants, had their chains, bells, and furniture of gold
and silver, attended with gilt banners and flags; and eight
or ten elephants waiting on him, clothed in gold, silver, and
silk. Thus passed about twelve companies, most richly furnished;
the first elephant having all the plates on his head
and breast set with rubies and emeralds, being a beast of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
wonderful stature and beauty. They all bowed down before
the king.”</p>

<p>The secret of this adulation was not any particular respect
to the king, as might be expected from this description.
When the elephant passed its royal master, the driver
perched upon its neck pricked him so violently with his instrument,
that the elephant bent its knee, raised its trunk,
and roared lustily with pain.</p>

<p>All kings and potentates could not afford to keep up
such an expensive establishment; and many were the tricks
that were resorted to, to make a few elephants afford a
great display. When Mr. Bell, the famous traveller, visited
Pekin, he was entertained by the officials with what
was intended to be a magnificent display of elephants.
“After dinner,” he says, “we saw the huge elephants,
richly caparisoned in gold and silver stuffs. Each had a
driver. We stood about an hour admiring these sagacious animals,
who, passing before us at equal distances,
returned again behind the stables, and so on, round and
round, till there seemed to be no end to the procession.
The plot, however, was discovered by the features and
dress of the riders: the chief keeper told us there were
only sixty of them.”</p>

<p>An Eastern account of the embassy from Shah Rohk, son
of Tamerlane, to the emperor of China, describes the grand
feast in China on New-Year’s Day, A.D. 1420. “The elephants were
adorned with a magnificence not to be expressed,
with silver seats and standards, and armed men upon their
backs. Fifty of them carried the musicians: these were preceded
or followed by fifty thousand, in profound silence and
order.” Undoubtedly the same mystification was adopted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
with the ambassadors as in the case of Mr. Bell, only it was
more successful.</p>

<p>In Rome, Julius Cæsar and his successors employed the
elephant to draw them in gorgeous chariots. When Cæsar
celebrated his victories in Gaul, elephants were used to carry
torches to illuminate the processions, which generally took
place after dark. In celebrating his African triumphs, the
captured spoils were borne upon chariots of ivory; and when
Pompey returned from his victories in Africa, he was borne
in a chariot that was drawn by four elephants of the largest
size, to the very gates of Rome.</p>

<p>Gibbon thus describes the triumph of Aurelian (A.D.
274):—</p>

<p>“The pomp was opened by twenty elephants, four royal
tigers, and above two hundred of the most curious animals
from every climate of the north, the east, and the south.
They were followed by one thousand six hundred gladiators,
devoted to the cruel amusement of the amphitheatre. The
triumphal car of Aurelian on this memorable occasion (it
had formerly been used by a Gothic king) was drawn either
by four stags or by four elephants.”</p>

<p>The most remarkable display of elephants in modern
times, is undoubtedly that made in honor of the visit of the
Prince of Wales to India. At Kandy, Ceylon, he witnessed
the wonderful festival of Perahara, in which long processions
of these noble animals passed in review, caparisoned in the
most costly manner, bearing howdahs that defy description.
One of the latter, which was presented to him at Jyepore,
was of silver, and a work of art in all its parts. At Agra,
the prince, mounted upon a huge elephant, covered with
costly trappings, passed in between a double line of elephants,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
bearing the native princes and men of rank, probably
the most imposing spectacle of his visit. At the rehearsal
of the Perahara at Kandy, the prince fed the great elephants
with sugar-cane, and with his suite, and numbers
of ladies and gentlemen, reviewed the host of giants. (<a href="#plate20">See
Plate XX.</a>)</p>

<p>At Lahore his Royal Highness was greeted with salutations from
long lines of gayly bedecked elephants, which,
with crowds of natives, extended for a great distance along
the drive: and finally, at Colombo, two huge pachyderms
were stationed, face to face, upon opposite sides of the road,
bearing upon their backs various ornamentations and placards
of welcome; and, when the prince appeared, the huge
animals raised their trunks aloft, and joined them over the
road, bearing aloft a crown. Under this living arch, the
austere company of guests and guards passed. (<a href="#plate19">See Plate
XIX.</a>)</p>

<p>Many of the conquests and ceremonies of the early days
are commemorated on medals, described in <a href="#CHAPTER_XX">Chap. XX.</a>; and
fine bass-reliefs are in existence, telling the story of the wonderful
deeds in which the elephant took no minor part.</p>

<span class="smaller">WAR ELEPHANTS OF MODERN ASIA.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>During the recent war between England and Burmah,
which resulted in the overthrow of King Theebaw, the
elephant was frequently mentioned in despatches as being a
valuable auxiliary to the troops when on the march; and that
these noble animals constitute an important feature of many
military posts in India, is, perhaps, not generally known.
Such, however, is the case; and the service they perform
when it is necessary to transport, troops, is invaluable. The
elephant is not only attached to divisions as a baggage-carrier,
but is utilized in actual service, elephant-batteries being
organized for field-work. The Bengal, Bombay, and Madras
artillery establishments each comprise an armament of two
eighteen-pounder S. B. guns, one eight-inch iron howitzer,
two eight-inch mortars, and two bronze mortars of five and
a half inch calibre, with seven gun-carriages and platforms,
and twenty-two ammunition-wagons drawn by bullocks.
Nine elephants and two hundred and ninety bullocks were
required for the battery, with ten riding mahouts, and one
hundred and fifty native drivers.</p>

<p>The appearance of an elephant-battery in the field is
very striking, and certainly the huge animals offer a good
target to the artillery of the opposing force. Each elephant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
has a large pad, or saddle, strapped upon it, upon which rests
the ammunition-box, or other article, as the case may be.
Upon the neck of each elephant sits the mahout; while behind
the ammunition-chest is stationed a soldier, who serves
out the shot to the man detailed to carry it. It is said that
the animals soon become accustomed to the noise of firing,
and do not mind it in the least.</p>

<p>In the last Burmese war, the variety of uses to which
these intelligent animals could be put, was shown on many
occasions. After Theebaw had been overthrown, the country
of Upper Burmah was overrun with gangs of robbers,
called <i>dacoits</i>. blood-thirsty miscreants who pillaged the villages
of peaceful natives, and even threatened Mandalay.
To suppress them, the armed steam-launches “Pegu” and
“Patrol” were sent up the river Sittang; and, in the chase,
the “Patrol” ran aground on a shoal. There were literally
no appliances for hauling her off, until some one happened
to think of the elephant: forthwith, a large tusker was harnessed
to the launch, and, urged by its mahout and the men
of the other launch near by, the huge animal plunged into
the river, and drew the heavy boat into deeper water.</p>

<p>Elephant-batteries have been used by the British Government in
various parts of the East. In the third command of
the Royal Artillery, the elephants transport the guns; and,
on their return from the Lughman-valley expedition, they
carried the battery in perfect safety across the dangerous and
rapid Cabul River, where, a few months previous, a number
of soldiers had lost their lives. When about to march, the
gun, limber, and eight ammunition-boxes are hoisted upon
the backs of the elephants in six minutes, fourteen gunners
being required to perform the service. In some of the batteries,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
camels are employed to bear the ammunition. Often,
when guns and carriages become caught in rocks or mud,
the elephant is used to rescue them. Count de Warren
mentions an instance that occurred in his brigade in the
Coorg war in India. He says, “Having reached a point
where the bed of the torrent fell in cascades, it became a
question as to the mode of raising the guns up the almost
vertical declivity of a granite rock, the surface of which the
waters had worn and polished. The oxen which drew the
cannon gave up the attempt after one or two efforts, and lay
down, as they always do in desperate cases. I was then determined
to send for some elephants of the convoy. Two of
the most docile were stripped of their loads, and led by their
guides to the place where the cannons were left. It was indicated
to them, by voice and gesture, what was expected from
their courage; and the confidence thus shown in them was
not misplaced. One of the colossal beasts, placing himself
behind the gun, applied the base of his trunk to it, and, pushing
it before him, whilst the cannoneers guided it, sent it up
the rocky chasm.”</p>

<p>An instance is recorded during the march to Lucknow in
1858, that illustrates the nerve of the elephant under fire,
and shows how perfect is their obedience to the mahout.
Gen. Outram, desiring to annoy the enemy’s flank, ordered the
elephant-battery into line. The guns were soon
dismounted; and, as soon as firing commenced, one of the
elephants, Kudabar-Moll, was stationed by his mahout, or
driver, behind the piece, and in a short time was almost
alone, the artillery-men being shot down by the musketry
of the enemy. Soon the man that served the shot fell, leaving
three men to fire the piece. This they did for a while;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
the elephant, acting under instructions of his mahout,
handing them cartridges from the wagon. As the last shot
was loaded, and before it could be fired, two men were killed,
and one badly wounded; yet he held up the match to
the elephant, who, at his driver’s command, touched it to the
vent, and fired the gun, the act being witnessed by a company of
infantry that came to the rescue, and ultimately put
to flight the opposing force.</p>

<p>In telling this story, it is very tempting to leave the mahout
out of the question, which was once done, giving the
elephant the entire credit; but it is quite enough that the
animal should obey so implicitly under such trying circumstances.</p>

<p>Elephants have been known, innocently of course, to turn
the tide of battle; and a story is told in Lahore, India,
of a noble old animal who was the standard-bearer in an
Indian battle, carrying on his broad back the royal ensign
which was the rallying-point of the Poonah host. For some
time the huge animal bore the standard in the midst of the
fray. Suddenly the enemy made a vigorous charge; and
the mahout at the same moment commanding him to halt,
the old elephant stood firm, while the opposing force came
on. The mahout dropped dead from his back; the men about
were routed, turned, and fled; and in a short time the elephant
was almost surrounded by the enemy. A moment
more, he would have been captured, when a mighty shout
rose from the retreating forces. They saw the standard still
firm on the elephant’s back; and, refusing to believe they
were beaten, with a victorious cry they charged the enemy
with such valor that they were swept down like chaff; and
the elephant, who still stood like a rock amid the dead and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
dying, was once more within its own lines, the true victor.
The mahout’s last command had been obeyed, and the animal
remained like a statue until some one took the dead
driver’s place.</p>

<p>In the last centuries, elephants were used much more than
at present, and an army camp was an extraordinary sight;
curiously enough, the attendants and camp-followers often
amounting to ten times the actual fighting-men. When the
Marquis Cornwallis took the field in the war with Tippoo,
the followers were estimated at one million souls. The
number of elephants, compared to the bullocks, horses, and
camels, was insignificant; but the rule was fifty elephants
to every eight thousand soldiers: and, to give an idea of
these astonishing campaigns, I introduce an account by an
officer who took part in this one, Lieut. Shipp.</p>

<p>“My post of baggage-master being a situation which is,
I believe, peculiar to India, it may not be improper to state
its duties. He is a staff-officer, and, when not employed in
his particular department, is attached to the suite of the
commander of the division as much as the commissary-general,
quartermaster-general, or any other staff-officer of the
division. On the line of march, he is held entirely responsible
that neither men nor baggage precede the column of
march, and that they are on their proper flank, which is
regulated by the general orders of the day. If the reader
recollect what I before stated, that he may safely calculate
ten followers in a Bengal army to every fighting-man; and
when he is informed, that, according to the calculations made
in our camp, including the several native contingencies we
had with us, our followers were not less in number than
eighty thousand men, women, and children; some thirty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
thousand following the army for what they could pick up, by
fair means or otherwise,—my situation cannot be supposed
to have been a sinecure. It was truly one of great labor
and activity. I had twenty men belonging to a corps of
local horse. These men were provided with long whips, and
placed at my disposal. To attempt to talk the numberless
camp-followers into obedience was quite out of the question,
and, therefore, these whips were for the purpose of lashing
them into something like discipline. To the great number
of human beings I have spoken of, must be added fifty elephants,
six hundred camels, five thousand bullocks, five
thousand horses, one thousand ponies, two hundred goats,
the same number of sheep, fifty ruts, one hundred palanquins,
one hundred dogs, and one hundred hackeries, or
carts.”</p>

<p>The elephant in a heavily wooded country is greatly appreciated
in time of war; as their huge bodies can crush
through the underbrush, trample down the reeds, and make
a good road, over which the gun-carriages and teams can be
hauled. A writer on an early Burmese war says, “The
road lay partly through a thick jungle; but with the aid
of three elephants, a passage was forced.” When a bog is
met, or roads have been overflowed, making ordinary passage
almost impossible, the elephants, under direction of their mahouts,
place their heads (the base of the trunk) against the
teams, and push them along, or take ropes attached to the
gun-carriages between their teeth, and haul them out of the mire.</p>

<p>Capt. Williamson lays much stress upon the importance
of the work performed by these animals. “Many of our
most arduous military operations have been greatly indebted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
for their success to the sagacity, patience, and exertion of
elephants. Exclusive of their utility in carrying baggage
and stores, considerable aid is frequently supplied by the
judgment they display, bordering very closely on reason.
When cannon require to be extricated from sloughs, the
elephant, placing his forehead to the muzzle,—which, when
limbered, is the head of the piece,—with an energy scarcely
to be conceived, will urge it through a bog, from which hundreds
of oxen or horses could not drag it. At other times,
lapping his trunk round the cannon, he will lift, while the
cattle and men pull forward. The native princes attach an
elephant to each cannon, to aid its progress in emergencies.
For this purpose, the animal is furnished with a thick leather
pad, covering the forehead, to prevent its being injured. It
has sometimes happened, that in narrow roads or causeways,
or on banks, the soil has given way under heavy cannon;
when an elephant, being applied to the falling side, has not
only prevented the piece from upsetting, but even aided it
forward to a state of security.”</p>

<p>Small howitzers, that can be placed upon the elephant’s
back, were not the only guns the animals had to carry.
Aurengzebe had cannon in his army which required twenty
yoke of oxen, besides elephants, who pushed at the wheels,
and hauled.</p>

<p>The patience and fidelity of the elephant when on the
march are proverbial, and they can nearly always be depended
upon. In the steep passes, or ghauts, of India, the work is
often of the most laborious description. An eye-witness thus
describes a scene where their pluck and sagacity were put
most thoroughly to the test:—</p>

<p>“There was a small ravine branching off from the bed of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
a dry river, in which our encampment lay, and its entrance
looked like the dreary access to some deep cavern. We
entered this little gaping cavern, leaving the principal part
of our force for the protection of our standing tents and
baggage. We were equipped as lightly as possible. Two
six-pounders were conveyed on elephants; and our march
seemed to lie through the bed of this ravine, which was
rocky, and watered by a crystal current, that rippled along
its flinty bed. We did not proceed at the rate of more than
one or two yards an hour,—ascending and descending every
twenty paces; at one time deep sunk in some dark excavation,
and shortly afterwards perched upon the summit of a
rock, the falling of the numerous cataracts drowning the
noise made by our approach.... Our march now became
more and more tardy, and the ascents and descents more
difficult and intricate. In some places, rocks of gigantic
size hung some hundred feet overhead. These sudden and
tremendous hills and dales indicated that we could not have
far to go; for the last hill was scarcely accessible.... We
halted a considerable time,—till broad daylight, when we
could see, from where I stood, the soldiers in advance of us,
ascending by means of projecting rocks and boughs. We
were halted in a kind of basin, surrounded by high hills.
In the course of a couple of hours, the whole of the Eighty-seventh
Regiment, with our gallant general and suite, ascended
this difficult ghaut. From this eminence we could
see a great distance; and on every hill we could discern
signals, which were communicated from post to post....
What will not good examples effect on the minds of soldiers?
Our general walked every yard of this critical march, encouraging
his men. The question now was, how to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
the guns up, and the powder and shot; but those who are
accustomed to wars in India, are not often at a loss for
expedients. Having got all the men up, except the rear-guard,
the pioneers went to work with their pickaxes, some
making a road, and others felling trees. As we were but
two regiments, the general’s primary object was to place our
little force to the best advantage. This accomplished, the
guns were our next object. Having cut a good deal of
the most prominent part of the hill away, and lain trees on
the ascent as a footing for the elephants, these animals were
made to approach it, which the first did with some reluctance
and fear. He looked up, shook his head, and, when
forced by his driver, roared piteously. There can be no
question, in my opinion, that this sagacious animal was
competent instinctively to judge of the practicability of the
artificial flight of steps thus constructed; for, the moment
some little alterations had been made, he seemed willing to
approach. He then commenced his examination and scrutiny,
by pressing with his trunk the trees that had been
thrown across; and after this he put his fore-leg on, with
great caution, raising the fore-part of his body so as to throw
its weight on the tree. This done, he seemed satisfied as to
its stability. The next step for him to ascend by, was a
projecting rock, which we could not remove. Here the same
sagacious examinations took place, the elephant keeping his
flat side close to the side of the bank, and leaning against
it. The next step was against a tree; but this, on the first
pressure of his trunk, he did not like. Here his driver made
use of the most endearing epithets, such as ‘wonderful, my
life,’ ‘my wife;’ but all these endearing appellations, of
which elephants are so fond, would not induce him to try<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
again. Force was at length resorted to; and the elephant
roared terrifically, but would not move. Something was
then removed; he seemed satisfied, as before: and he in time
ascended that stupendous ghaut. On his reaching the top,
his delight was visible in a most eminent degree: he caressed
his keepers, and threw the dirt about in a most playful manner.
Another elephant, a much younger animal, was now
to follow. He had watched the ascent of the other with the
most intense interest, making motions all the while, as
though he was assisting him by shouldering him up the
acclivity,—such gestures as I have seen some men make
when spectators of gymnastic exercises. When he saw his
comrade up, he evinced his pleasure by giving a salute something
like the sound of a trumpet. When called upon to
take his turn, however, he seemed much alarmed, and would
not act at all without force. When he was two steps up,
he slipped, but recovered himself by digging his toes in the
earth. With the exception of this little accident, he ascended
exceedingly well. When this elephant was near the
top, the other, who had already performed his task, extended
his trunk to the assistance of his brother in distress, round
which the younger animal intwined his, and thus reached the
summit of the ghaut in safety. Having both accomplished
their task, their greeting was as cordial as if they had been
long separated from each other, and had just escaped from
some perilous achievement. They mutually embraced each
other, and stood face to face for a considerable time, as if
whispering congratulations. Their driver then made them
salaam to the general, who ordered them five rupees each for
sweetmeats. On this reward of their merit being ordered,
they immediately returned thanks by another salaam.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>The British forces in India during a war rarely put elephants
into the field for active service, the animals being too
conspicuous, and too valuable to risk. But with the Burmese,
this was different; they were prodigal of their elephants.
During a Burmese war, a garrison of infantry and cavalry
marched out with seventeen war elephants, fully caparisoned,
and bearing a number of armed men. They advanced upon
a fort amid a murderous fire, which killed the men upon
them, and their mahouts; but in no case did an elephant
lose its head. They stood the fire steadily until their
mahouts were shot; and then, feeling themselves unrestrained,
they slowly and calmly walked back to their
fort, their bravery and courage being greatly admired by
the opposing force.</p>

<p>In the last half-century, in any revolt, or where Indian native
troops have been brought against the English, elephants
have been rarely used; experience showing that their slow
movements render them unfit for valuable or active service
in the field.</p>

<p>Perhaps the last time they were seen in their former
grandeur was in the war of Coromandel, when the British
were fighting the native chiefs. The latter came out on
some occasions equipped like the old Mogul emperors, to be
described later on. The nabob of Arcot and his famous
rival, Chundasaheb, both came upon the field on elephants;
and had not a French bullet put an end to the former, a duel
by these potentates would have been witnessed. As soon as
the nabob caught sight of his rival’s elephant, bedecked with
its owner’s standard, he became furious, and offered his mahout
a valuable reward if he would make his elephant overthrow
that of his enemy, who was the author of his defeat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
The mahout was urging the elephant on, when a bullet struck
the nabob in the heart, and he fell from the howdah. Soon
after this tragic event, Nazir-jing, a son of the Mogul, entered
the Carnatic with a most imposing force,—a battalion of
thirteen hundred elephants, three hundred thousand soldiers,
and eight hundred pieces of cannon. He, too, was shot from
his elephant.</p>

<p>An elephant duel was observed in the field between
Murzafa-jing, the Soubah of the Carnatic, and the nabob of
Canoul. The elephants of the rivals were urged toward each
other by the mahouts; and Murzafa-jing raised his sword to
strike, when his adversary thrust his javelin, which pierced
his forehead, killing him on the spot. At the same instant,
at least a thousand bullets were fired at the nabob, who also
fell, mortally wounded, from his elephant.</p>

<p>The introduction of fire-arms into warfare was the cause
of the withdrawal of the elephant from active field-work.
The great creature was too prominent a target, and the men
upon its back were the most conspicuous objects in the field.
It was a long time, however, before the natives would give
up this animal, so strong was custom. From its back, the
old generals directed their warriors and the movements of
the battle; and, when the elephant left the field, it was
usually a sign that a retreat had been ordered, and rout
generally followed.</p>

<p>In the battle in which Aurengzebe gained the victory over
Dara, he ordered his elephant’s legs to be chained, so that he
could not retreat. Bernier tells this story as follows:—</p>

<p>“Calil-ullah had suffered some indignity at the hands of
Dara, and he considered the hour arrived when he might
gratify the resentment which had never ceased to rankle in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
his bosom. His abstinence from all share in the battle did
not, however, produce the mischief intended, Dara having
proved victorious without the co-operation of the right wing.
The traitor, therefore, had recourse to another expedient.
He quitted his division, followed by a few persons; and riding
with speed towards Dara, precisely at the same moment when
that prince was hastening to assist in the downfall of Morud-Bakche,
he exclaimed, while yet at some distance, ‘Mohbarek
bad! Hazaret! Salamet! Elhamd-ul-ellah! May you be
happy! May your Majesty enjoy health, and reign in safety!
The victory is your own! But let me ask, why are you still
mounted on this lofty elephant? Have you not been sufficiently
exposed to danger? If one of the numberless arrows
or balls, which have pierced your canopy, had touched your
person, who can imagine the dreadful situation to which we
should be reduced? In Heaven’s name, descend quickly,
and mount your horse: nothing now remains but to pursue
the fugitives with vigor. I entreat your Majesty, permit
them not to escape.’</p>

<p>“Had Dara considered the consequences of quitting the
back of his elephant, on which he had displayed so much
valor, and served as a rallying-point of the army, he would
have become master of the empire; but the credulous prince,
duped by the artful obsequiousness of Calil-ullah, listened to
his advice as though it had been sincere. He descended
from the elephant, and mounted his horse; but a quarter
of an hour had not elapsed, when, suspecting the imposture,
he inquired impatiently for Calil-ullah. The villain was
not, however, within his reach; he inveighed vehemently
against that officer, and threatened him with death; but
Dara’s rage was now impotent, and his menace incapable of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
being executed. The troops having missed their prince,
a rumor quickly spread that he was killed, and the army
betrayed; a universal panic seized them; every man thought
only of his own safety, and how to escape from the resentment
of Aurengzebe. In a few minutes the army seemed
disbanded, and (strange and sudden reverse!) the conqueror
became the vanquished. Aurengzebe remained for a quarter
of an hour steadily on his elephant, and was rewarded with
the crown of Hindostan. Dara left his own elephant a few
minutes too soon, and was hurled from the pinnacle of glory
to be numbered among the most miserable of princes.”</p>

<p>The younger brother of Dara, the famous Sultan Sujah,
lost his empire in an almost identical manner, or owing to
the elephant being a rallying-point. A French engineer
raised the siege of Daman by an ingenious device. They
had a large supply of fireworks, principally rockets; and,
sallying forth, they fired them in among Aurengzebe’s elephants,
causing them to turn on their own troops, creating
the greatest confusion and an ultimate rout.</p>

<p>In the old Mogul empire, the armor of elephants called to
mind that used in the age of chivalry. The elephants of
Akbar wore plates of massive iron upon their foreheads;
while the king of Ternassery, who was famous for his enormous
elephants, all being selected, like the Swiss Guard, for
their great size, had his animals covered completely with
armor made of beef-hides, which were fastened beneath the
stomach with heavy chains. The “Ayeen Akbery” (a native
work) “is more minute. ‘Five plates of iron, each one
cubit long and four fingers broad, are joined together by
rings, and fastened round the ears of the elephant by four
chains, each an ell in length; and betwixt these another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
chain passes over the head, and is fastened in the <i>kellawah</i>;
and across it are four iron spikes, with <i>katasses</i> and iron
knobs. There are other chains, with iron spikes and knobs,
hung under the throat and over the breast, and others fastened
to the trunk: these are for ornament, and to frighten
horses. <i>Pakher</i> is a kind of steel armor that covers the body
of the elephant: there are other pieces of it for the head and
proboscis. <i>Gejjhemp</i> is a covering made of three folds, and
is laid over the <i>pakher</i>.’ Dow adds, that ‘a sword is bound
to their trunk, and daggers are fastened to their tusks.’ But
the mighty power of the animal in crushing the ranks of an
enemy was principally relied upon. The armor and the
swords were to add to the dismay which an immense troop
of elephants were of themselves calculated to produce. The
emperor of Akbar well knew their power in scattering masses
of terrified men. On one occasion, when he stormed the fort
of Chitar, the garrison retired to the temples. ‘Akbar, perceiving
he must lose a great number of his troops in case of
a close attack, ordered a distant fire to be kept up upon the
desperate Rajaputs, till he had introduced three hundred
elephants of war, which he immediately ordered to advance
to tread them to death. The scene now became too shocking to
be described. Brave men, rendered more valiant by
despair, crowded around the elephants, seized them even by
the tusks, and inflicted upon them unavailing wounds. The
terrible animals trod the Indians like grasshoppers under
their feet, or, winding them in their powerful trunks, tossed
them aloft into the air, or dashed them against the walls
and pavements. Of the garrison, which consisted of eight
thousand soldiers and of forty thousand inhabitants, thirty
thousand were slain, and most of the rest taken prisoners.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
In the rapid marches of this victorious prince, the elephants
suffered greatly. Purchas, speaking of his progress from
Kashmire in 1597, says, ‘This country he left when summer
was past, and returned to Lahore, losing many elephants
and horses in the way, both by famine, then oppressing the
country, and the difficulty of the passages; the elephants
sometimes, in the ascent of the hills, helping themselves
with their trunks, leaning and staying themselves, being
burthened, thereon, as on a staff.’”</p>

<p>The terror which elephants produced on foot-soldiers
was well appreciated three centuries ago, and victory was
generally gained by the side that possessed the greatest
number of these animals. The fear of elephants was the
greatest difficulty the famous adventurer Timour had to
deal with when on his victorious march through Persia,
Siberia, and Russia. His men replied to his war-speeches,
“We may subdue Hind; yet it hath many ramparts, rivers,
wildernesses, and forests; soldiers clad in armor; and the
elephants, the destroyers of men.”</p>

<p>When the army arrived upon the plains in front of Delhi,
he had to take the most extraordinary precautions to prevent
this morbid fear from resulting in a rout. An enormous
ditch was built around the camp, to prevent an inroad of
invading elephants. Buffaloes were tied together by the
neck, and arranged about the ramparts, and their horns
bedecked with rushes, while men were stationed to set them
on fire at the first approach of the terrible elephants. What
would have been the effect of this conflagration on the unfortunate
bullocks, imagination can picture. The opposing
force to Timour in this battle (A.D. 1399) was the Sultan
Mamood, and the remarkable armament of his elephants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
was certainly enough to strike terror to the boldest heart.
His army consisted of ten thousand horse, forty thousand
foot-soldiers, and elephants. The latter were arrayed in
armor, and mounted with bastions filled with men armed
with crossbows. Their tusks were elongated with poisoned
daggers; and on scaffolds hung to the sides stood armed men,
bearing fire and melted pitch and iron-pointed rockets to hurl
and throw at the enemy. As this army marched forward,
the men upon their backs beating kettledrums, cymbals,
bells, and trumpets, the brave followers of Timour fell back,
utterly demoralized, before the appalling sight; and the commander
himself fell upon his knees in prayer,—a characteristic one:
“As my vast conquests have caused the destruction of a
great number of God’s creatures, I have resolved to
atone for the crimes of my past life by exterminating the
infidels of China.” In some way the Delhi elephants threw
their own left wing into disorder. Timour’s horsemen rushed
forward; and the elephants, demoralized at their sabre-cuts,
fled in great confusion, while the sharp weapons aimed at
their trunks left many upon the field. As the great animals
fled, Timour’s men saw that the elephants were not invincible, and,
rushing to the front, completed the disastrous rout.
Timour’s grandson, a boy of fifteen, made himself conspicuous by
attacking and wounding an elephant, overthrowing
its riders, and driving the huge animal into his grandfather’s
camp. The day following the battle of Delhi, Timour sat
upon the throne of the Indian monarch, and a procession of
twelve rhinoceroses and one hundred and twenty captive
elephants were paraded before him; and afterwards sent as
presents to the Persian provinces; while the unfortunate
people were slaughtered by his soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>Elephants were not always demoralized in these wars; and
in another battle this same conqueror had the front of his
army protected by a line of elephants, their towers filled
with archers and Greek fire-flingers. At the word of command they
started forward, their drivers ordering them to
coil their trunks so that the sabres of the Mamelukes could
not reach them.</p>

<p>The Syrians fled before them, and were crushed under
foot; others were hurled forty or fifty feet into the air; the
defeat being complete, and chiefly due to the elephants.</p>

<p>Timour’s curious experiment of adopting elephants in warfare, after
he had witnessed their demoralization, was not
without precedent, as Kublai Khan and Alexander did the
same. Marco Polo gives a clear idea of the way elephants
were used in battle:—</p>

<p>“It happened, that, in the year 1272, the Grand Khan sent
an army into the countries of Vochang and Karazan, for their
protection and defence against any attack that foreigners
might attempt to make.... When the King of Mien and
Bangala in India, who was powerful in the number of his
subjects, in extent of territory, and in wealth, heard that an
army of Tartars had arrived at Vochang, he took the resolution
of advancing immediately to attack it, in order that by
its destruction the Grand Khan should be deterred from again
attempting to station a force upon the borders of his dominions.
For this purpose he assembled a very large army, including a
multitude of elephants (an animal with which his
country abounds), upon whose backs were placed battlements, or
castles, of wood, capable of containing the number of
from twelve to sixteen in each. With these, and a numerous
army of horse and foot, he took the road to Vochang, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
the Grand Khan’s army lay, and, encamping at no great distance
from it, intended to give his troops a few days of rest.
The King of Mien, learning that the Tartars had descended
into the plain, immediately put his army in motion, took up
his ground at the distance of about a mile from the enemy,
and made a disposition of his force, placing the elephants in
the front, and the cavalry and infantry in two extended
wings in their rear, but leaving between them a considerable
interval. Here he took his own station, and proceeded to
animate his men, and encouraging them to fight valiantly,
assuring them of victory, as well from the superiority of
their numbers, being four to one, as from their formidable
body of armed elephants, whose shock the enemy, who had
never before been engaged with such combatants, could by
no means resist. Then, giving orders for sounding a prodigious
number of warlike instruments, he advanced boldly with
his whole army towards that of the Tartars, which remained
firm, making no movement, but suffering them to approach
their intrenchments. They then rushed out with great
spirit and the utmost eagerness to engage; but it was soon
found that the Tartar horses, unused to the sight of such
huge animals, with their castles, were terrified, and, wheeling
about, endeavored to fly, nor could their riders by any exertions
restrain them; whilst the king, with the whole of his
forces, was every moment gaining ground. As soon as the
prudent commander perceived this unexpected disorder,
without losing his presence of mind, he instantly adopted
the measure of ordering his men to dismount, and their
horses to be taken into the wood, where they were fastened
to the trees. Being dismounted, the men, without loss of
time, advanced on foot towards the line of elephants, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
commenced a brisk discharge of arrows: whilst, on the other
side, those who were stationed in the castles, and the rest
of the king’s army, shot volleys in return, with great activity;
but their arrows did not make the same impression as
those of the Tartars, whose bows were drawn with a stronger
arm. So incessant were the discharges of the latter, and all
their weapons (according to the instructions of their commander)
being directed against the elephants, these were
soon covered with arrows, and, suddenly giving way, fell
back upon their own people in the rear, who were thereby
thrown into confusion. It soon became impossible for their
drivers to manage them, either by force or address. Smarting
under the pain of their wounds, and terrified by the
shouting of the assailants, they were no longer governable,
but, without guidance or control, ran about in all directions,
until at length, impelled by rage and fear, they rushed into
a part of the wood not occupied by the Tartars. The consequence
of this was, that, from the closeness of the brandies
of large trees, they broke, with loud crashes, the battlements,
or castles, that were upon their backs, and involved in the
destruction those who sat upon them. Upon seeing the
rout of the elephants, the Tartars acquired fresh courage;
and filing off by detachments, with perfect order and regularity,
they remounted their horses, and joined their several
divisions, when a sanguinary and dreadful combat was renewed.
The battle ended in a complete victory.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable displays of elephants were
those of Kublai Khan. In an old cut before me, he is
shown as he appeared on his elephants, after he had conquered
his unfortunate relative, Nazam, and smothered him
between two carpets. He is represented in a large wooden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
castle, which rests upon four large tuskers, whose bodies,
according to Dow, were protected with coverings of thick
leather hardened by fire, over which were housings of cloth
of gold. The castle contained many crossbow men and
archers; and on the top of it was hoisted the imperial standard,
adorned with representations of the sun and moon.</p>

<p>In his invasions into Hindostan, in the eleventh century,
Mamood of Ghizni employed a magnificent army of thirteen
hundred elephants. Dow thus describes his battle with the
King of Kaslegar:—</p>

<p>“Mamood, perceiving the enemy’s progress, leaped from
his horse, and, kissing the ground, invoked the aid of the
Almighty. He instantly mounted an elephant-of-war, encouraged
his troops, and made a violent assault upon Elich.
The elephant, seizing the standard-bearer of the enemy, folded
round him his trunk, and tossed him aloft into the sky. He
then pressed forward like a mountain removed from its place
by an earthquake, and trod the enemy like locusts under his
feet. When Mamood invested Callinger, the rájah of that
city sued for peace, and offered him three thousand elephants
and other presents. The Indian prince probably considered
that his enemy might be unacquainted with the habits of the
animal; and he, therefore, ventured upon an experiment, not
very likely to conciliate the rough hero of Turquestan. The
king (Mamood) agreed to the terms proposed; and the raja,
to try the bravery of the sultan’s troops, intoxicated the elephants
with certain drugs, and let them loose, without riders,
in the camp. Mamood, seeing the animals advancing, perceived
the trick, by the wildness of their motions, and immediately
ordered a party of his best horse to seize, kill, and
drive them from the camp. Some of the Turks, emulous to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
display their bravery in the presence of their king and of both
armies, mounted the greatest part of the elephants, and drove
the rest into an adjacent wood, where they were soon reduced
to obedience.”</p>

<p>In the Book of Maccabees, there is an interesting passage
describing the armor of elephants, and their use in the wars
of Asia after the conquest of India:—</p>

<p>“To the end they might provoke the elephants to fight,
they shewed them the blood of grapes and mulberries.
Moreover, they divided the beasts among the armies, and for
every elephant they appointed a thousand men, armed with
coats of mail, and with helmets of brass on their heads; and
beside this, for every beast were ordered five hundred horsemen
of the best. These were ready at every occasion:
wheresoever the beast was, and whithersoever the beast
went, they went also, neither departed they from him. And
upon the beasts were there strong towers of wood, which
covered every one of them, and were girt fast unto them with
devices: there were also upon every one thirty-two strong
men, that fought upon him, beside the Indian that ruled
him.”</p>

<p>These are but a few selections from many, showing the
importance of the elephant in comparatively modern times.
And when we remember what an imposing appearance
twenty elephants, the largest number ever seen in America
together, make, we can imagine the scene when over a thousand
of these huge beasts were arranged in line, each clad in
armor, and bearing armed warriors.</p>

<span class="smaller">WAR ELEPHANTS OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT AND HIS SUCCESSORS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The earliest mention of war elephants is made by Ctesias,
where he describes Cyrus as making war against
King Amoræus, who placed a large number of elephants in
ambush, putting the horses of Cyrus to flight. Ælian quotes
Ctesias as saying that the king of the Indians went to war
with an army of ten thousand elephants, which was undoubtedly
an exaggeration.</p>

<p>In olden times, elephants seemed to be a necessity, and
would-be conquerors were often put to some remarkable
straits to procure them. Perhaps the most amusing substitution
was that adopted by Queen Semiramis, who made
mock elephants out of hides, and put camels within them,
with what laughable results Diodorus Siculus shall tell us.
The story is so quaint, and replete with curious situations,
that I give it complete in the language of the old historian:—</p>

<p>“Semiramis, having settled her affairs in Egypt and Ethiopia,
returned with her army into Asia to Bactria; and now
having a great army, and enjoying a long peace, she had
a longing desire to perform some notable exploit by her
arms. Hearing, therefore, that the Indians were the greatest
nation in the whole world, and had the largest and richest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
tract of land of all others, she resolved to make war upon
them.</p>

<p>“Stabrobates was at that time king, who had innumerable
forces, and many elephants, bravely accoutred, and fitted to
strike terror into the hearts of his enemies. For India, for
the pleasantness of the country, excelled all others; being
watered in every place with many rivers, so that the land
yielded every year a double crop; and by that means was
so rich, and so abounded with plenty of all things necessary
for the sustenance of man’s life, that it supplied the inhabitants
continually with such things as made them excessively
rich, insomuch that it was never known that there was ever
any famine amongst them, the climate being so happy and
favorable; and upon that account, likewise, there is an incredible
number of elephants, which for courage, and strength
of body, far excel those in Africa. Moreover, this country
abounds in gold, silver, brass, iron, and precious stones of
all sorts, both for profit and pleasure. All of which being
noised abroad, so stirred up the spirit of Semiramis, that
(though she had no provocation given her) yet she was
resolved upon the war against the Indians. But knowing
that she had need of great forces, she sent despatches to all
the provinces, with command to the governors to list the
choicest young men they could find; ordering the proportion
of soldiers every province and country should send forth,
according to the largeness of it; and commanded that all
should furnish themselves with new armor and arms, and
all appear in three years’ time at a general rendezvous in
Bactria, bravely armed and accoutred in all points. And
having sent for shipwrights out of Phoenicia, Syria, Cyprus,
and other places bordering upon the seacoasts, she prepared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
timber for them fit for the purpose, and ordered them to
build vessels, that might be taken asunder, and conveyed
from place to place whenever she pleased. For the river
Indus bordering upon that kingdom, being the greatest in
those parts, she stood in need of many river-boats to pass
it, in order to repress the Indians. But being there was no
timber near that river, she was necessitated to convey the
boats thither by land from Bactria. She further considered,
that she was much inferior to the Indians in elephants (which
were absolutely necessary for her to make use of): she therefore
contrived to have beasts that should resemble them,
hoping by this means to strike a terror into the Indians,
who believed that there were no elephants in any place but
in India. To this end, she provided three hundred thousand
black oxen, and distributed the flesh amongst a company of
ordinary mechanics, and such fellows as she had to play the
cobblers for her, and ordered them, by stitching the skins
together, and stuffing them with straw, to imitate the shape
of an elephant; and in every one of them she put a man to
govern them, and a camel to carry them, so that at a distance
they appeared to all that saw them, as if they were really
such beasts.</p>

<p>“They that were employed in this work, wrought at it
night and day, in a place which was walled round for the
purpose, and guards set at every gate, that none might be
admitted either to go in or out, to the end that none might
see what they were doing, lest it should be noised abroad,
and come to the ears of the Indians.</p>

<p>“Having therefore provided shipping and elephants in the
space of two years, in the third she rendezvoused all her
forces in Bactria. Her army consisted (as Ctesias says)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
of three millions of foot, two hundred thousand horse, a
hundred thousand chariots, and a hundred thousand men,
mounted upon camels, with swords four cubits long. The
boats that might be taken asunder, were two thousand;
which the camels carried by land as they did the mock-elephants,
as we have before declared. The soldiers made
their horses familiar with these feigned beasts, by bringing
them often to them, lest they should be terrified at the sight
of them; which Perseus imitated many ages after, when he
was to fight with the Romans, who had elephants in their
army out of Africa. However, this contrivance proved to
be of no advantage, either to him or her, as will appear in
issue herein a little after related.</p>

<p>“When Stabrobates, the Indian king, heard of these great
armies, and the mighty preparations made against him, he
did all he could to excel Semiramis in every thing. And
first, he built of great canes four thousand river-boats, for
abundance of these canes grow in India about the rivers; and
ferns, so thick as a man can scarce fathom; and vessels made
of these reeds (they say) are exceeding useful, because they
will never rot or be worm-eaten.</p>

<p>“He was very diligent, likewise, in preparing of arms,
and going from place to place throughout all India, and so
raised a far greater army than that of Semiramis. To his
former number of elephants he added more, which he took
by hunting, and furnished them all with every thing that
might make them look terrible in the face of their enemies;
so that, by their multitude and the completeness of their
armor in all points, it seemed above the strength and power
of man to bear up against the violent shock of these creatures.</p>

<p>“Having, therefore, made all these preparations, he sent
ambassadors to Semiramis (as she was on her march towards
him), to complain and upbraid her for beginning a war without
any provocation or injury offered her; and by his private
letters, taxed her with a dissolute course of life; and vowed
(calling the gods to witness), that, if he conquered her, he
would nail her to the cross. When she read the letter, she
smiled, and said the Indian should presently have a trial of
her valor by her actions. When she came up with her army
to the river Indus, she found the enemy’s fleet drawn up in
a line of battle; whereupon she forthwith drew up her
own, and, having manned it with the stoutest soldiers, joined
battle, yet so ordering the matter as to have her land-forces
ready upon the shore, to be assisting as there should be occasion.
After a long and sharp fight, with marks of valor
on both sides, Semiramis was at length victorious, and sunk
a thousand of the enemy’s vessels, and took a great number
of prisoners. Puffed up with this success, she took in the
cities and islands that lay in the river, and carried away an
hundred thousand captives. After this, the Indian king
drew off his army (as if he fled for fear), but in truth to
decoy his enemies to pass the river. Semiramis, therefore
(seeing all things fall out according to her wish), laid a broad
bridge of boats (at a vast charge) over the river, and thereby
passed over all her forces, leaving only threescore thousand
to guard the bridge, and with the rest of her army pursued
the Indians. She placed the mock-elephants in the front,
that the enemy’s scouts might presently inform the king
what multitudes of elephants she had in her army: and she
was not deceived in her hopes; for when the spies gave an
account to the Indians what a great multitude of these creatures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
were advancing towards them, they were all in amaze,
inquiring among themselves, whence the Assyrians should
be supplied with such a vast number of elephants: but the
cheat could not long be concealed; for some of Semiramis’s
soldiers, being laid by the heels for their carelessness upon
the guard (through fear of further punishment), made their
escape, and fled to the enemy, and undeceived them as to
the elephants; upon which the Indian king was mightily
encouraged, and caused notice of the delusion to be spread
through the whole army, and then, forthwith, marched with
all force against the Assyrians; Semiramis, on the other
hand, doing the like. When they approached near one to
another, Stabrobates, the Indian king, placed his horse and
chariots in the vanguard, at a good distance before the main
body of his army. The queen, having placed her mock-elephants at
the like distance from her main body, valiantly
received her enemy’s charge: but the Indian horse were
most strangely terrified; for in regard, the phantasms at
a distance seemed to be real elephants, the horses of the
Indians (being inured to these creatures) pressed boldly and
undauntedly forward; but when they came near, and saw
another sort of beast than usual, and the smell and every
thing else almost being strange and new to them, they broke
in with great terror and confusion, one upon another, so that
they cast some of their riders headlong to the ground, and
ran away with others (as the lot happened) into the midst
of their enemies; whereupon Semiramis, readily making use
of her advantage, with a body of choice men, fell in upon
them, and routed them, forcing them back to their main
body: and though Stabrobates was something astonished at
this unexpected defeat, yet he brought up his foot against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
the enemy, with his elephants in the front; he himself was
in the right wing, mounted upon a stately elephant, and
made a fierce charge upon the queen herself, who happened
then to be opposite to him in the left. And though the
mock-elephants in Semiramis’s army did the like, yet they
stood the violent shock of the other but a little while: for
the Indian beasts, being both exceeding strong and stout,
easily bore down and destroyed all that opposed them, so
that there was a great slaughter; for some they trampled
under foot, others they rent in pieces with their teeth, and
tossed up others with their trunks into the air. The ground,
therefore, being covered with heaps of dead carcasses, and
nothing but death and destruction to be seen on every hand,
so that all were full of horror and amazement, none durst
keep their order or ranks any longer. Upon which the
whole Assyrian army fled outright: and the Indian king
encountered with Semiramis, and first wounded her with an
arrow in the arm, and afterwards with a dart (in wheeling
about) in the shoulder; whereupon the queen (her wounds
not being mortal) fled, and by the swiftness of her horse
(which far exceeded the other that pursued her), she got
off.”</p>

<p>Curiously enough, in early times the camel was used in
Persia, instead of the elephant, to carry burdens. The
name of the elephant is not found in the Hebrew language;
but the Grecian and Roman poets made frequent mention
of it one hundred years before the time of Alexander, so that
he must have known something of the strange animal when
he contemplated his Indian invasion. He first met them in
the flesh, according to Arrian, in the battle of Arbela, where
he defeated the king of Persia, who had a few in his army,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
which Alexander captured. Soon after this he was presented
with a number which had been brought from India by Darius,
and later the victorious army of the great soldier captured a
number on the banks of the Indus. It is known that Alexander
was familiar with the advantages to be derived from
elephants, but whether he added them immediately to his
army is not known. One military writer, Polyænus, states
that he did, and that a fine battalion of elephants was placed
upon the left wing of the Macedonian army. But, on the
other hand, Alexander said, according to Quintus Curtius,
“I have so despised those animals, that, when I had them at
my command, I did not employ them.” Alexander is pictured on
a medal, a cut of which was published in the “Museum
Cuspinianum,” edited by Laurentius Legatus, as riding
in a chariot drawn by elephants when entering Babylon.</p>

<p>When Alexander passed the Indus, he met the army of
King Porus with a large force of elephants. “There,” writes
Quintus Curtius, “stood those huge bulks of overgrown
bodies, the elephants; which, being on purpose provoked,
filled the air with a horrible noise.” The river had to be
passed with boats; and the great danger to be apprehended
was, that the horses of the Greeks, upon perceiving the elephants,
would be seized with fear, and leap into the water.
For several days the Macedonians and the Indians lay encamped
on the opposite banks of the river, the one effecting
to attempt the passage by stratagem, the other constantly
resisting the attempt with the terror of the elephants. Porus,
however, relaxing in his watchfulness, and being deceived by
a division of a part of the army of Alexander, the great body
of the Macedonians were safely conveyed across. But the
Indian king was resolved not to yield up his dominions without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
a struggle. “He drew up his army in order of battle,”
says Arrian, upon “a plain where the soil was not incommodious
by reason of the slippery clay, but firm and sandy,
and every way fit wheeling his chariots round upon. First,
he placed the elephants in the front, at the distance of one
hundred feet from each other, to cover the whole body of
foot, and at the same time to strike a terror into Alexander’s
horse; for he imagined that none, either horse or foot,
would be so hardy as to endeavor to penetrate through the
spaces between the elephants. The horsemen, he thought,
could not, because their horses would be terrified at the
sight; and the foot would not dare, because the armed soldiers
would be ready to gall them on each hand, and the elephants
to trample them under their feet. The foot possessed the
next rank. They were not, indeed, placed in the same order
with the elephants, but so small a way behind that they
seemed to fill up the interstices. At the extremities of
each wing he placed elephants bearing huge wooden towers,
wherein were armed men. The foot were defended on each
hand by the horse, and the horse by the chariots, which were
placed before them.”</p>

<p>“With the caution which is the best characteristic of a skillful
general, Alexander resolved to avoid a direct attack upon
the main body of the elephants. Perhaps the alarm which
his soldiers are described to have felt at ‘those beasts, which,
being disposed amongst the men in front, at a distance bore
the appearance of towers,’ might have somewhat influenced
this determination. The elephant which carried Porus himself,
a man of extraordinary stature, was greatly superior to
all the lest in height. Alexander is described as rejoicing in
the splendid appearance of the enemy which he trusted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
subdue. ‘At last I have met with a danger suitable to the
greatness of my soul.’ The long pikes of the Macedonian
phalanx, the rapid movements of the cavalry, and the cloud
of arrows poured in by the light-armed Thracians, soon spread
a panic amongst the Indians. But the elephants for a long
time sustained the assaults of their impetuous enemies.
They trampled the infantry under their feet; and ‘the most
dismal thing of all was when these animals took up the armed
soldiers with their trunks, and delivered them up to their
governors on their backs.’ The day was far spent, and still
the fight was doubtful, till at length the Macedonians directed
all their power against the sagacious beasts that threatened
to baffle the skill and bravery of the most disciplined
troops of the earth. The Greeks chopped their legs with
axes, and cut off their trunks with a crooked weapon resembling
a scythe. While the infantry of Alexander thus encountered
the principal strength of the Indians, his cavalry
closed round them in overwhelming masses. ‘And the beasts
now being pent up in a narrow space, and violently enraged,
did no less mischief to their own men than the enemy; and
as they tossed and moved about, multitudes were trampled to
death; besides, the horse being confined among the elephants,
a huge slaughter ensued, for many of the governors of the
beasts being slain by the archers, and the elephants themselves,
partly enraged with their wounds, and partly for
want of riders, no longer kept any certain station in the
battle, but running forwards, as if madness had seized them,
they pushed down, slew, and trampled under foot friends
and foes without distinction; only, the Macedonians, having
the advantage of a more free and open space, gave way, and
made room for the furious beasts to rush through their ranks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
but slew them whenever they attempted to return. But the
beasts at last, quite wearied out with wounds and toil, were
no longer able to push with their usual force, but only made
a hideous noise, and, moving their fore-feet heavily, passed
out of the battle.”</p>

<p>“Although his forces were scattered all around him, the
courage of the Indian king remained unconquerable. Exposed
‘as a mark at which every one levelled,’ he had received
nine wounds, before and behind; but he still continued
to hurl his javelins at the enemy, till they might be said ‘to
drop from his faint arm, rather than be delivered.’ The governor
of Porus’s elephant at last put the beast to flight, and
Alexander himself slowly followed him upon a wounded
horse. At length Porus, exhausted by his wounds, slid
down from the back of the elephant; and the Indian guide,
thinking the king desired to alight, commanded the animal
to kneel down. The whole of the elephants were accustomed
to imitate the movements of that upon which the king rode;
and in like manner they instantly knelt down, and thus
became a prey to the conquerors. Their habitual obedience
to their masters involved their common ruin.”</p>

<p>An interesting medal is known to antiquarians, which is
supposed to commemorate this victory of Alexander over
Porus. On one side is shown the head of Alexander, covered
with an elephant’s head-skin, and on the other a representation
of Minerva, armed with a helmet, shield, and spear, and
before her an eagle holding lightning in its talons. Whether
Alexander used the elephants he captured, or not, is not
known; but he preserved them, and created a new office,—the
<i>elephantarch</i>, or governor of the elephants, whose business
it was to take entire charge of them. At the death of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
Alexander, great numbers of elephants were owned by the
Macedonians; and his successors, who had, perhaps, more
faith in them for purposes of war, often used them in many
of the sanguinary engagements of their time.</p>

<p>Many of the elephants of King Porus were afterwards employed
by Eumenes; and, in his fiercely contested battle with
Antigonus, elephants were used on both sides. In the attack
made upon the city of Megapolis by Polysperchon, the latter
employed sixty-five elephants which were considered invincible;
but the foot-soldiers of the other army stole out,
and built ditches in front of them, placing upright spears
and spikes in them, and covering all with grass and leaves.
When the elephants and the army charged, the great animals
fell into the traps, and during the confusion the entire force
was routed.</p>

<p>In those times the expense of keeping elephants was enormous,
and oftentimes the animals suffered greatly. At the
siege of Pydua, in Macedonia, the elephants were obliged to
eat sawdust; and many died, or, as Diodorus Siculus says,
“pined away for want of food.” In the histories of the wars
that were waged between the generals of Alexander and
Ptolemy, elephants are often mentioned, and were evidently
relied upon more than any branch of the service. Diodorus
Siculus says, when Perdiccas marched to the Nile, and assaulted
the fort called the “Camel’s Wall,” he “boldly led
up his army close to the fort, and forthwith the targeteers
with their ladders mounted the wall; and those that rode
upon elephants threw down the fortifications, and demolished
the bulwarks. Whereupon Ptolemy, with those of his own
guard about him, to encourage the rest of his officers and
friends manfully to behave themselves, catched hold of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
sarissa, and mounted the bulwark; and so, being on the
higher ground, struck out the eyes of the foremost elephant,
and wounded the Indian that sat upon him; and as for
those that scaled the walls, he hurled them down, dreadfully
cut and wounded, into the river. After his example, Ptolemy’s
friends valiantly exerted themselves; and, by killing
the Indian that governed the next elephant, the beast became
unserviceable.” When Ptolemy and Seleucus attacked Demetrius
at Gaza, their first care was to protect their army
from the shock of the elephants of their enemy; and for this
purpose they prepared “an iron palisado, sharp-pointed with
iron, and fastened together with chains.” That this precaution
was not taken in vain, the same author shows in the
following: “And now, when the fight between the horse
had been a long time doubtful, the elephants, forced on by
the Indians, made so terrible an onset that it appeared impossible
for any force to have stood against them. But when
they came up to the palisado, the darters and archers sorely
galled both the beasts and their riders; and being still forced
on, and whipt by the Indians, some of them stuck upon the
sharp points of the palisado, with which, besides the multitude
of the darts and arrows that galled them, they were in
such pain and torment that they caused a horrible tumult and
confusion: for these creatures, in plain and level places, bear
down all before them; but in those which are rough and
craggy, they are of no use or service, because of the tenderness
of their feet. Ptolemy, therefore, wisely foreseeing of
what advantage this palisado would be, by that means frustrated
the rage and fury of the beasts. At length, most of
the Indians that rode them being killed, all the elephants
were taken, upon which the greatest part of Demetrius’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
horse were in such a consternation that they forthwith
fled.”</p>

<p>Where elephants created so much confusion and demoralization,
it was but natural that the great generals should
invent mechanical devices to rout them in turn, and create
disorder; and we read that Ptolemy was often successful.
Yet he fully appreciated the value of the elephants; and,
after meeting them in several engagements, he determined to
possess an elephant army of his own. The enemy obtained
their elephants from India; and, although the African elephants
were not considered so well fitted for war purposes,
he decided to secure his recruits from the Dark Continent.
He immediately issued an edict prohibiting their slaughter,
and ordered that they be captured alive. Exactly where
these great creatures were obtained would be interesting to
know, but Ptolemy’s historians do not tell us. Ptolemy III.
has left an inscription called adulis, found in the travels of
Cosmas, a traveller of the sixth century, to the effect that
the elephants were obtained from Ethiopia, and the country
of the Troglodytes.</p>

<p>The famous battle of Raphia, between Ptolemy Philopator,
the fourth of the dynasty, and Antiochus the Great, in which
numbers of elephants were employed, is thus described by
Polybius: “The signal was sounded to engage; and the elephants,
approaching first, began the combat. Among those
that belonged to Ptolemy, there were some that advanced
boldly against their adversaries. It was then pleasing to
behold the soldiers engaged in close combat from the towers,
and pushing against each other with their spears. But the
beasts themselves afforded a far nobler spectacle, as they
rushed together, front to front, with the greatest force and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
fury. For this is the manner in which they fight. Twisting
their trunks together, they strive, each of them with his
utmost force, to maintain his own ground, and to move his
adversary from his place; and when the strongest of them
has at last pushed aside the trunk of the other, and forced
him to turn his flank, he then pierces him with his tusks in
the same manner as bulls in fighting wound each other with
their horns. But the greater part of the beasts that belonged
to Ptolemy declined the combat. For this usually happens
to the elephants of Afric, which are unable to support either
the smell or cry of the Indian elephants. Or rather, perhaps,
they are struck with terror at the view of their enormous size
and strength; since even before they approach near together,
they frequently turn their backs, and fly. And this it was
which at this time happened. As soon, therefore, as these
animals, being thus disordered by their fears, had fallen
against the ranks of their own army, and forced the royal
guards to break the line, Antiochus, seizing the occasion,
and advancing round on the outside of the elephants, charged
the cavalry, which was commanded by Polycrates, in the
extremity of the left wing of Ptolemy. At the same time,
also, the Grecian mercenaries, who stood within the elephants,
near the phalanx, advanced with fury against the
peltastæ, and routed them with little difficulty, because
their ranks, likewise, were already broken by the elephants.
Thus the whole left wing of the army of Ptolemy was
defeated, and forced to fly.”</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty years after this, a successor of
Antiochus employed elephants in battles against the Jews;
and nearly all the monarchs who succeeded Alexander employed
them in war. They were used in Syria; and Seleucus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
Nicator valued them so highly, that, according to Strabo,
he gave Sandrocottus an entire province on the Indus for
five hundred of the animals. They were stabled at Apamea,
in Syria; so that elephants commanded a high price, even
in these early times. Two centuries later, when Syria and
various Eastern countries became tributary to Rome, the war
elephant fell into disuse; and one of the last references to it
in Syria is found on a coin struck in honor of Antiochus,
surnamed Epiphanes Dionysius, who succeeded to the throne
in the two hundred and twenty-fifth era of the Seleucidæ
(87 B.C.). It represents an elephant bearing a torch, after
the custom of Syrian monarchs; a horn of plenty being shown
behind it. (<a href="#plate21">See Plates XXI., XXII.</a>)</p>

<span class="smaller">WAR ELEPHANTS OF THE ROMANS AND CARTHAGINIANS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The war elephant was a feature of the armies of the Orient
many years before it was known in Italy. We have
seen that the huge animal was especially effective in spreading
terror among the opposing hosts, from its gigantic size
and peculiar form: and nations that had never heard of, nor
seen, an elephant, were so demoralized at the sight, that they
often fled without giving battle; their horses and other animals,
equally alarmed, completing the rout and confusion.
The Romans were no exception to this; and, with all their
valor and courage, they quailed before the astonishing array
of monsters—for so they considered them—that King Pyrrhus
of Epirus brought upon the field in the reign of Heraclear
(280 B.C.). His elephant detachment was a small one,
being composed of twenty animals, which bore upon their
backs tall wooden towers filled with armed bowmen. The
Romans soon rallied, however; but their defeat, according to
Floras, was directly due to the terror inspired by the elephants.
When Fabricus went to Epirus to negotiate with
Pyrrhus for an exchange of prisoners, the latter endeavored
to bribe him, and then to frighten him, by producing one of
the largest of his elephants. But the old Roman replied on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
leaving, “Neither your gold yesterday, nor your beast to-day,
has made any impression upon me.”</p>

<p>Four years later the Romans had become perfectly familiar
with elephant warfare; and Curius Dentalus organized his
men especially to demoralize the elephants, ordering them
to attack the animals with burning torches in one hand, and
sharp swords in the other. This plan was successful, and
was aided by an unforeseen accident. An elephant calf accompanied
its mother upon the field of battle; and, becoming
wounded early in the fight, its roars so enraged its mother,
and demoralized the others, that they charged, and threw the
troops of Pyrrhus into complete disorder. They were finally
captured by the Romans, and four led in triumph to Rome,—the
first ever taken there.</p>

<p>To show what vague notions of the elephant the Romans
had, they called the great creatures Lucanian oxen; and, according
to Pliny, the Roman writers, in general, gave them
this name, probably because they first saw them in Lucania.</p>

<p>King Pyrrhus was extremely unfortunate in the management
of his elephants. At the siege of Argos, when his men
had battered in the gates of the town, the mahouts lost control
of the beasts in the excitement, and they attempted to
rush through the low gates; but the tall towers struck them,
and forced them back in great disorder, and many of their
own soldiers and masters were trampled under foot, and
killed. In describing this event, Plutarch relates that one
of the elephants exhibited remarkable courage and affection
for its rider; keeping a large number of enemies at bay when
its master was dismounted, finally taking him in its trunk,
and removing him to a place of safety. The animal doubtless
received some instruction from its master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>The old writers were fond of accrediting to the elephant
many more virtues, courage, generosity, and self-sacrifice,
than they seem to possess to-day; and, undoubtedly, they
often gave the animals credit for spontaneous actions, when
they were really obeying a command of their mahout, or
driver. I have referred particularly to this and the opinions
of Sanderson in the chapter devoted to the intelligence of the
elephant. Plutarch and Ælian both record the story of
an elephant of Porus that drew darts from its master’s body.
Such may have been the case; but I think, if true, it was at
the direct order of Porus, and not actuated by compassion,
as the old authors would have us believe.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that the Romans had acquired some experience
with Asiatic elephants, as, soon after, they became
involved in a series of wars in which the enemy employed
large numbers of African elephants. Their familiarity with
the Asiatic elephants did not always avail them. In the
first Punic war, Regulus, the Roman consul, the Buonaparte
of his time, captured a division of eighteen elephants in the
battle of Adis; but on another occasion, Xantippus, the
Lacedemonian, the general of the Carthaginian troops, used
his elephant batteries, as we may call them, so judiciously,
and with such marked skill, that the Romans were utterly
routed. The elephants, under direction of their enraged
riders, and infuriated themselves by their wounds, charged
into the fleeing Romans, trampling them under foot, tossing
them high in air, and goring them with their tusks; committing
such frightful carnage, that for a long time the
Romans dreaded to meet them.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians not only fought with elephants on their
own soil, but they carried them into Sicily. At the siege of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
Panormus (Palermo), they employed one hundred and forty
African elephants in a solid phalanx, a most impressive sight,
and moved upon the city. But the Romans fired at them
with darts from the city-walls, and turned the huge animals
upon their own men. Then taking advantage of the confusion,
Metellus, the Roman consul, who was in command, led
his troops upon the Carthaginians, and utterly routed them,
and captured one hundred or more of their finest war
elephants.</p>

<p>Such a victory offered a rare opportunity to Metellus to
exhibit his prowess and the spoils to his countrymen: so he
commanded that an immense raft be built, composed of
empty barrels covered with planks, and in turn packed with
earth; and upon this the elephants were floated over the
straits to Rhegium (Reggio). For some time the Romans
kept the noble creatures on exhibition, and treated them
with great indignity, driving them about the circus with
blunted spears; all of which was undoubtedly done to convince
the people that the elephant was not the terrible beast
he had been pictured, and to erase from the public mind the
terror they had inspired when Regulus was defeated. Again,
it was the custom to parade captive kings before the populace
in chains, and treat them with great indignity; and the
elephants probably came under this head. When the Roman
citizens were surfeited with the display, it occurred to the
state that a herd of animals that could devour seventy-two
thousand pounds of green food in twenty-four hours was a
great luxury; and in a moment of economy, according to
Verrius, who is cited by Pliny, the unfortunate captives were
killed.</p>

<p>That the Romans overcame their fear of elephants did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
prevent the Carthaginians from retaining them as an important
branch of the service. Hannibal carried them into
Spain; and after the capture of Saguntum (218 B.C.), we
hear of him sending to Africa for a new supply.</p>

<p>In the second Punic war, which commenced about this
time, Hannibal began operations on Roman soil with an army
of fifteen thousand men, and, according to Appian and Eutropius,
thirty-seven elephants. He crossed the Pyrenees, and
the Rhone at Orange. Livy, Silius Italicus, and Polybius,
all describe some of the events of this campaign; but that of
the latter is the most comprehensive and valuable, giving,
evidently, a correct account of the management of war
elephants at this time. The Greek historian says,—</p>

<p>“Hannibal having posted his cavalry as a reserve on the
side towards the sea, commanded the infantry to begin their
march, while himself waited to receive the elephants, and
the men that were left with them on the other side of the
river. The passage of the elephants was performed in the
following manner: When they had made a sufficient number
of floats, they joined two together, and fastened them strongly
to the ground, upon the bank of the river. The breadth of
both together was about fifty feet. To the extremity of these
they fixed two more, which were extended over into the
water; and to prevent the whole from being loosened and
carried down the river by the rapidity of the current, they
secured the side that was turned against the stream, by strong
cables, fastened to the trees along the bank. Having in this
manner finished a kind of bridge, which was extended to the
length of about two hundred feet, they then added to it two
other floats of a much larger size, which were very firmly
joined together, but were fastened in so slight a manner to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
the rest, that they might at any time be separated from them
with little difficulty. A great number of floats were fixed
to these last floats, by the help of which, the boats that were
designed to tow them over might hold them firm against
the violence of the stream, and carry them in safety with the
elephants to the other side. They then spread a quantity
of earth over all the floats, that their color and appearance
might, as nearly as was possible, resemble the ground on
shore. The elephants were usually very tractable upon land,
and easy to be governed by their conductors, but were at
all times under the greatest apprehensions whenever they
approached the water. Upon this occasion, therefore, they
took two female elephants, and led them first along the
floats; the rest readily followed; but no sooner were they
arrived upon the farthest floats, than, the ropes being cut
which bound them to the rest, they were immediately towed
away by the boats towards the other side. The elephants
were seized with extreme dread, and moved from side to side
in great fury and disorder. But when they saw that they
were every way surrounded by the water, their very fears at
last constrained them to remain quiet in their place. In this
manner, two other floats being from time to time prepared
and fitted to the rest, the greater part of the elephants were
carried safely over. There were some, indeed, that were so
much disordered by their fears, that they threw themselves
into the river in the midst of their passage. This accident
was fatal to the conductors, who perished in the stream: but
the beasts themselves, exerting all their strength, and raising
their large trunks above the surface of the river, were by
that means enabled not only to breathe freely, but to discharge
the waters also, as fast as they received them; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
having, by long struggling, surmounted likewise the rapidity
of the stream, they at last all gained the opposite bank in
safety.”</p>

<p>Hannibal’s march along the bank of the Isère, in his approach
to the famous pass of the Little St. Bernard, was attended
by many dangers. The natives mounted the sides of
the high passes, and hurled huge rocks and bowlders down
upon the elephants and men. But everywhere the strange
beasts produced the greatest terror; and, as they approached
the Alps, forces that had gathered to oppose them fled at the
sight of them. The march was accomplished in fifteen days,
at an enormous loss, the passes being strewn with men and
beasts.</p>

<p>Many elephants were lost in the mountain passes, but
enough were saved to make a formidable appearance in
the battles of Ticinus and Trebia. How so many were
taken over, considering the nature of the Alpine passes,
is somewhat astonishing; and it is stated by Livy, that
in some places the elephants of Macedon were delayed
while special bridges were constructed for them to cross.
Hannibal, on the other hand, pushed through with the
energy that characterized all his movements; and the passage
of his army and elephants through the Alps is one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
of the most remarkable feats in military history, ancient
or modern.</p>

<p>Ancient history contains interesting accounts of the battles
in which the elephant took part. Livy says that the
Gauls, who were the allies of the Romans, fled before them.
According to Appian, the Roman horse were alarmed at the
sight and smell of the strange animals; and Silius Italicus
gives the elephant of Hannibal full credit for all his victories.
The poet of the Punic war thus, in characteristic
language, describes a fight between an elephant and a Roman
soldier:—</p>

<p>After the battle of Trebia, the elephants were marched
with the army, over the Apennines; and Livy tells us that
seven starved to death; later, in passing the Arno, which
was a raging torrent, numbers of men, elephants, and horses
were swept away, the only elephant left being the one the
great general himself rode.</p>

<p>Previous to this, in crossing the Po, Hannibal had arranged
his elephants in a long line across the shallow river,
to break the force of the stream by a living dam. Perdiccas
did the same, in an unfortunate attempt to cross the Nile
near Memphis; but the waters of the Arno were too swift,
and, notwithstanding the fact that elephants are fine swimmers,
they were carried away and drowned. Hannibal was
not cast down by his misfortune, and immediately sent for
a new supply of elephants from Carthage. At the battle of
Cannæ (216 B.C.),’the Roman forces attacked the elephants
with torches, and succeeded in firing the towers upon their
backs. This terrible scene is thus described by Silius Italicus:—</p>

<p>It would seem that Hannibal was sometimes actuated by
motives similar to those of our Indians of the West, who, in
former days, sometimes offered to release prisoners of war,
if they would defeat a number of warriors in a struggle.
After the battle just referred to, he offered some Roman prisoners
their liberty if they could conquer the elephants. One
of the Romans accepted the offer, and actually killed the
elephant single-handed. But Hannibal broke his word, perhaps
fearing, that, if such an instance was circulated among
the Roman soldiers, they would lose their fear of the animals;
so he had the courageous Roman murdered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>When the Carthaginians were before Capua, they had a
strong force of elephants, and we read of their obtaining
re-enforcements from Carthage as early as 215 B.C.; so that
this city must have been a central depot of elephant supplies.</p>

<p>The management of war elephants in Spain was mostly
conducted by Asdrubal, who was in command of the Carthaginian
forces in the absence of his brother. According to
Livy, he was defeated in the famous fight between the two
Scipios at Tortosa, but managed to save his elephants. In
other battles, large numbers of these animals were killed and
left upon the field.</p>

<p>The effect of a panic among the war elephants was greatly
dreaded by the generals who owned them; and Asdrubal provided
his drivers with a knife and mallet, with instructions,
if the elephant became unmanageable, to drive the knife
between the junction of the head and spine. In the battle
of Metaurus, this expedient was also employed. The
Romans attacked them with such ferocity, that the elephants
turned, and began trampling their own troops; and, in obedience
to their instructions, the drivers slaughtered six while
in their headlong flight, falling with them to the ground.
This, however, did not prevent the utter rout of the forces;
and, in a frenzy of rage, Asdrubal threw himself single-handed
at a battalion of the enemy, and fell, opposed by
thousands.</p>

<p>It is evident that in these days the range of the African
elephant extended farther to the north; and that they were
much more abundant, is shown by some passages in the old
works. Thus, when Scipio was about to invade Africa, the
Carthaginians made great preparations to prevent his advance;
and, according to Appian, a large number of elephants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
were taken in a short time, and trained for war. This
could not have been done if they had to be sought at a great
distance. They may have been found in Barbary, which
would explain the ease with which re-enforcements were
made in all these wars.</p>

<p>When Scipio invaded Africa, Mago, the brother of Hannibal,
proceeded against Italy with a new and magnificent
army; and the vast array of elephants he drew up before the
Roman cavalry on the field of Insubria, is said to have been
almost unequalled in the annals of ancient warfare. Notwithstanding
this, the Romans were successful. Scipio was
followed into Africa by Hannibal; and the two warriors, both
equally famous, met on the field of Zama. Hannibal had
eighty elephants in line, a formidable array; but Scipio,
aware that his horses were useless, sent them to the rear,
and ordered his archers to direct their arrows at the trunks
of the elephants of the enemy. So vigorous was the assault,
that the elephants, panic-stricken, turned, and in a moment
were rushing wildly to the rear; their trumpeting, and the
cries of the dead and dying trampled under foot, producing
an indescribable scene. The entire right wing of the Carthaginian
general was broken, and, utterly routed, he retreated
to Adrumetum; the action of his own elephants
bringing to a close the second Punic war (201 B.C.). A
treaty of peace was now arranged; and with due respect for
the elephant, as an engine of war, the Romans bound the
unfortunate Carthaginians to deliver up all their war elephants,
and never tame others for military service. The
elephants captured by Scipio were forwarded to Rome;
and in his triumphal procession to the Capitol, they followed
the sacrificial victims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<p>Curiously enough, for a period of eighty years after the
Romans became familiar with the advantages of the elephant
as a valuable adjunct to the service, they did not employ
them. The warriors, however, were specially drilled in elephant
warfare; and many devices were invented by the skilful
generals to discomfit the huge animals. The great object
was to turn the elephants upon their own masters, as we
have seen; and to this end, the men were directed to fire their
darts and arrows at the trunk of the elephant, which was
known to be the most sensitive point. Chariots were constructed
to bear men who carried enormously long spears.
The horses were clothed in mail, and trained to charge at
the elephants at full speed; and, as they passed, the spearmen
would prod them in the trunk, and endeavor to demoralize
them. This branch of the service was, necessarily, one of
great danger, and the courageous lancers often lost their
lives; horses, chariots, and men, all being crushed to death
by the infuriated animals.</p>

<p>Another corps of elephant-men were armed with a peculiar
armor, covered with long, sharp spikes, so that the elephant
would not attempt to seize them with its trunk. Other soldiers
were armed with slings, with which they threw stones
at the driver of the elephant, it being their sole business to
dismount him; while instruments that could propel their own
darts were employed against the body of the elephant.
Besides these offensive movements, the troops were drilled
in the manner of receiving an elephant’s charge. They executed
manœuvres in falling back as the animal came on, and
in closing in to surround him. Such were a few of the
methods employed against the elephant, which serve to
show its importance in ancient warfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>Rome was finally forced to use the elephant herself; and
in the first action of the Macedonian war, they formed no
inconspicuous corps of the Roman army.</p>

<p>In the third year of the war, according to Polybius, Titus
Quintius Flaminius used them with signal advantage against
the Macedonian king. In the second Macedonian war, thirty
years later, Q. Martius Philippus employed them against
Perseus, the last king of Macedon. The latter, unlike his
predecessor, who conquered India, had neglected to provide
himself with a corps of elephants; and his horses were utterly
demoralized by the animals possessed by his enemy. Finding
that elephants were necessary to success, he conceived
the idea of manufacturing some bogus ones, after the fashion
of Semiramis, quoted in a previous chapter, and had a number of
wooden elephants made, in the interior of which was
concealed a man, who blew upon a trumpet which led into
the wooden throat, when the charge was ordered; hoping in
this way to imitate living elephants. But the ruse did not
succeed; and, after a war of four years, the Macedonians
came under the Roman yoke.</p>

<p>In some of these wars, it often happened that the African
elephant was marched against its Asiatic ally. This was the
case in the battle of Magnesia, when the Roman arms were
turned against Antiochus, king of Syria; and, according to
the old writers, the African elephants of Scipio were much
inferior in size and strength to the Indian ones of Antiochus.
The reverse, at least regarding size, is true to-day; and the
same was probably true then, African male elephants being
at least a foot taller than their Asiatic cousins.</p>

<p>When Scipio found that his elephants were inferior, he
placed them in his rear as a reserve; but they were routed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
only fifteen escaping: while fifteen thousand men were slain.
The Romans utterly defeated them, and insisted upon the
same terms which we have seen the Carthaginians made,—Antiochus
agreeing to deliver all his war elephants to Rome,
and to train no more. If both parties had kept their word,
the elephant would have fallen into disuse as a war-factor.</p>

<p>The Romans exacted a similar bond from Jugurtha (111
B.C.); killing large numbers, and continuing the war until
the Numidian king consented, and delivered his elephants to
Metellus (108 B.C.).</p>

<p>Julius Cæsar probably considered that elephants retarded
active movements, and did not have a large corps of them;
though a certain number were kept, presumably to re-assure
the soldiers, in case the enemy should be supplied with an
elephant corps. In his battle with Scipio in Africa, he was
confronted with thirty of these animals, having towers of
archers; but he sent his elephants to the rear, and succeeded
in defeating his enemy.</p>

<p>Some idea of the manner in which elephants fought in
battle is given by Cæsar:—</p>

<p>“A wounded elephant, furious with rage, attacked an
unarmed follower of the troops, and, kneeling upon him,
crushed the life out of his body. A veteran of the fifth
legion rushed forward to attack the beast, who was roaring,
and lashing with his proboscis. The elephant immediately
forsook his victim, and, catching up the soldier in his trunk,
whirled him in the air. But the intrepid warrior did not
lose his presence of mind: he wounded the elephant in his
sensitive proboscis, till, exhausted with pain, he dropped the
soldier, and fled in terror to his companions.”</p>

<p>The elephant was probably not used to any extent in war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
by the Romans, after the establishment of the imperial government.
In A.D. 193, we read that Rome was filled with
horses and elephants, ready for use in the proposed war
between Didius Julianus and Septimius Severus. In the
famous battle between Alexander Severus and Artaxerxes
(A.D. 230), three hundred elephants were taken from the
Persians, and a number marched to Rome in solemn state.
The introduction of new appliances of war, and the successful
attempts in routing bodies of elephants, probably did
much to render them unpopular, for a time at least, among
the Roman conquerors.</p>

</div>

<p>In the history of nearly all animals, there will be found
associated some curious fiction.</p>

<p>In Burmah and Siam, the white elephant is supposed, by
some, to be the abode of a transmigratory Buddha; and in
India, certain elephants with a single right tusk are reverenced.
In China, the tusks of the mammoth are used in
medicine; and in some of the old works, the mammoth itself
is described as a huge rat, which lives under the ground in
burrows, formed by the tusks, or teeth. The origin of this
fable lies in the fact, that, as mammoths were always found
beneath the surface, it was assumed, that, when alive, they
lived there. Early anatomists stated that the elephant’s
head was a storehouse for the water which it blew out of its
trunk.</p>

<p>It was formerly believed that elephants shed their tusks,
as do deer their horns. Ælian says that they drop them
once in ten years, which, all things considered, is quite often
enough. Pliny repeats the story, but adds some private information
of his own, to the effect that they always hid their
tusks underground.</p>

<p>This curious error has found its way into many comparatively
modern works: thus, Sir William Jardine states, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
the naturalist’s library, that “the tusks are shed about the
twelfth or the tenth year.”</p>

<p>Many strange beliefs were entertained regarding the
elephant of Ceylon. Travellers of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, as Pyrard, Bernier, and Phillipe, stated that
this elephant was the superior of all others in India, both
physically and mentally; and Tavernier is supposed to be
authority for the statement, that, if a Ceylon elephant be introduced
among others, the latter will instinctively do him
homage by touching the ground with their trunks.</p>

<p>Phile records the fact that elephants have two hearts. He
argued that this was so, because the animal showed extremes
of temperament,—one heart controlling the beast when
good-humored and docile, and the other when it exhibited
the characteristics of the rogue.</p>

<p>The older naturalists had few opportunities for making
careful anatomical examinations of the elephant, and, naturally,
fell into many errors; one of which was, that elephants
from sixteen to twenty feet high were not uncommon.
Major Denman observed some in Africa which he “guessed”
were sixteen feet high; though he afterwards measured one
that had been killed, which was twelve feet six inches at the
back. Works were published in the last century, which gave
the height of the animal as from twelve to fifteen feet; and
Sir John Hill, M.D., in his “Natural History of Animals,”
1752, states that elephants were said to measure, when full
grown, twenty feet at the shoulder.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that this was a gross exaggeration.
Reference has been made, in a previous chapter, to the size of
elephants; and it will be found that a twelve-foot animal is
an extreme rarity. The skeleton that is preserved in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
St. Petersburg museum, which is said to stand sixteen feet
and a half high, is the tallest known, being a foot taller than
the skeleton of the fossil elephant which was discovered at
Jubbalpore. It is doubtful if the European mammoth or
the American form, <i>Elephas Americanus</i>,—a tooth of which
is shown in <a href="#plate1">Plate I.</a>,—attained this height. One of the
largest elephant skeletons to be seen in this country belongs
to the Chicago Medical College, and represents an
elephant shot in a gorge of the Himalaya Mountains, about
a thousand miles from Calcutta, in 1865. Its dimensions are
as follows:—</p>

<p>Some extremely interesting measurements have been made
of the skeleton of the elephant Jumbo, by Professor Ward of
Rochester, who compares them, in a pamphlet, with a skeleton
of the <i>Mastodon giganteus</i>, discovered at Orange County,
N.Y. It is too lengthy and technical to be introduced in
this connection. The measurements already given are sufficient
to show that the elephants of over eleven or twelve
feet are extremely rare, while those of eighteen and twenty
belong to the world of fiction.</p>

<p>The absence of joints was a feature of the elephant, according to
some of the old writers. Sir Thomas Browne, in his
“Pseudodoxia Epidemica,” says, “It hath no joynts;” and
“being unable to lye down, it lieth against a tree, which
the hunters observing doe saw almost asunder, whereon the
beast relying, by the fall of the tree falls also downe itselfe,
and is able to rise no more.” Sir Thomas thinks that “the
hint and ground of this opinion might be the grosse and
somewhat cylindrical composure of the legs of the elephant,
and the equality and less perceptible disposure of the joynts,
especially in the fore-legs of the animal, they appearing, when
he standeth, like pillars of flesh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p>The honor of discovering jointless animals belongs properly
to Pliny, who described the <i>machlis</i>, a Scandinavian animal
without joints. Cæsar, in describing the wild animals of the
Hercynian forests, mentions the alce, “in color and configuration
approaching the goat, but surpassing it in size, its head
destitute of horns, and its limbs of joints.” It is evident that
Aristotle had some doubt as to whether elephants possessed
joints in their knees; and Ælian, writing two hundred years
later, perpetuated the error, expressing his surprise that the
elephants in Rome could dance, when they had no joints.
This fiction was taken up by the poets of the time, and is
found in many old writings. Phile, a contemporary of Dante,
addressed a poem on the elephant to the Emperor Andross
II., in which he expressed the same belief; and Solinus introduced
it into his fable “Polyhistor.” Though the error was
corrected in the year 802, it was revived by Matthew Paris in
the thirteenth century, who made a drawing of the elephant
presented to King Henry III. by the King of France, in
1255. The animal was represented without joints.</p>

<p>Shakspeare was a victim to the popular belief, and says in
“Troilus and Cressida,”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His legs are for necessity, not for flexure.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Donne, in his “Progress of a Soul,” sang of nature’s great
masterpiece, an elephant,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“The only harmless great thing.</div>

<p>I have previously referred to the fact that the mammoth
was considered by the Chinese to be an underground, rat-like
creature; and in many countries the bones of fossil elephants
have been considered those of giants.</p>

<p>In the time of James II., Lord Cherbury was appointed by
the king to investigate some bones which had been unearthed
near Gloucester; and there was much discussion about them.
Many considered them to be the remains of a giant, but
scientific men proved them to be those of an elephant.</p>

<p>In the reign of Louis XIII., the scientific world was greatly
excited over the remains of an alleged giant, which were dug
up in Dauphiné; and so divided was public opinion, that the
doctors took sides against one another, some claiming that
they were the bones of the giant Tentobrochus. One doctor,
named Mazurier, exhibited the remains in Paris, and stated
in a pamphlet that they were found in a sepulchre thirty feet
long, on the upper stone of which was written <i>Tentobrochus
rex</i>, the name of the king of Cimbri, who fought against
Marius.</p>

<p>In 1577 a gigantic skeleton of an elephant was unearthed
in Lucerne; and Professor Felix Pläten of Basle made an
examination, by order of the council, and concluded that it
was the skeleton of a man nineteen feet in height. The
natives of Lucerne were exceedingly proud of this. Goliath
was only eleven feet tall; and the giant Gabbarus of Pliny,
who lived in the time of Claudius, was about ten feet; but
these were pygmies compared to this ancestor of the people
of Lucerne, and they determined to commemorate his memory in a
fitting manner, namely, in employing a representation to support
the arms of the city. The design was made
by Professor Pläten; and some of the original bones are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
still to be seen in the museum of the Jesuit college in
Lucerne.</p>

<p>As late as 1645, the skeleton of an elephant found at
Crems in Austria was considered a giant; though Dr. Behrens
argued that such could not be the case, as “the tallest
man we know of was Og of Basan, whose bed is said, in
Deuteronomy, chap. iii., to have been eighteen feet long: now,
allowing the bed to be but one foot longer than the man, he
was seventeen feet high.”</p>

<p>Even in the last century, the doctors of Germany prescribed as
an absorbent, astringent, and sudorific, the “Ebur
fossile,” or “Unicornu fossile,” which was merely the tusk of
an elephant.</p>

<p>In the present days, few believers in these old fables can
be found: the stories of the milk and hoop snakes, the nautilus
and its sails, and other pleasant fictions, seem to have
superseded them.</p>

<p>Shakspeare judges this class perhaps not unfairly in “The
Tempest,” when he says,—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will
lay out ten to see a dead Indian.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
